### About

I'm a computer science major and have little to no background. I want to join SASE in hopes of making more friends and connections as I also transferred to Drexel this quarter.

### Career Goals

My career goals are to network and make a living off of going with computer science. I don't really have a specific job I have in mind. I just hope to make a good living from it. 

### Interests

My interests were reading manhwa and manga but now I just scroll on tiktok. I do want to start trying new things though as I'm kind of home bound. 

### Looking For

I'm looking for a mentor to make connections and gain anything else valuable from them.
