### About

I’m a thoughtful and reflective person who’s always looking to grow and make meaningful connections. I try to stay true to myself, but I’m also open to new experiences and learning from others. I tend to be pretty introspective, which helps me understand my emotions and thoughts on a deeper level. At the same time, I care about making a positive difference, whether it’s in my relationships or the world around me. 

### Career Goals

My dream job right now is to work with EWB-USA, where I can help build a better world through engineering projects that empower communities to meet their basic needs. I’m passionate about using engineering to solve real-world problems and want to equip leaders to address some of the world’s biggest challenges. I’m also interested in tackling these issues from an interdisciplinary angle—bringing together politics, economics, society, and the environment to create solutions that are accessible and affordable for people everywhere. Sustainability is really important to me, and I hope to work in a field where I can turn innovative ideas into practical systems that make a lasting impact.

### Interests

My Interests include playing the piano, composing songs, songwriting, basketball, swimming, running, art & design, reading (especially non-fiction), writing, cooking. 

### Looking For

I’m looking for someone experienced in engineering, especially in sustainable development and interdisciplinary projects. For me, It’s important that they’re knowledgeable and well-connected in the field. I want a mentor who is approachable and supportive, shares my values, and encourages my growth while helping me balance work and life. I appreciate someone who is open about their own experiences and can offer insights on navigating challenges. Ultimately, I’m seeking a mentor who genuinely cares about helping me integrate all my interests within engineering and is committed to guiding me along the way.
