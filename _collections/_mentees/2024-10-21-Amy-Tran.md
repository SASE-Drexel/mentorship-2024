about: I am a very introverted person who typically gets tired after a couple hours in the day. But I really love meeting new people and talking when I need to. I used to do cross country and played tennis leisurely. I still continue running occasionally because it helps clear my mind. My friends would describe me as someone who is kind, sincere, and understanding. I also typically like to separate my school life and home life, so I like to do work in the library and then go home to chill without having to worry much things.

### About

I am a very introverted person who typically gets tired after a couple hours in the day. But I really love meeting new people and talking when I need to. I used to do cross country and played tennis leisurely. I still continue running occasionally because it helps clear my mind. My friends would describe me as someone who is kind, sincere, and understanding. I also typically like to separate my school life and home life, so I like to do work in the library and then go home to chill without having to worry much things.

### Career Goals

My biggest career goal is to be able to work with NASA. But, in general my career goal is to be able to work as an astrophysicist or aerospace engineer.

### Interests

Things I like to do on my free time is read, learn how to bake, play with my dog, run, or honestly just binge tv shows. Some of my favorite genres are, mystery, horror, action, and romance-comedy.

### Looking For

Iâ€™m looking for someone who could help me with just navigating through my Drexel career. Basically things like student life, being more involved, studying tips, and how to stay on track. Maybe some personal things as well???
