about: I am an electrical engineering major hoping to get enough sleep every night. Typically I like to plan out my days, but sometimes I get too lazy or just like to wing it. I could be shy/quiet at first, but I'm pretty talkative once I get comfortable. While I love to explore the city to find scrumptious food, I also like spending time in my room.
year: Sophmore

### About

I am an electrical engineering major hoping to get enough sleep every night. Typically I like to plan out my days, but sometimes I get too lazy or just like to wing it. I could be shy/quiet at first, but I'm pretty talkative once I get comfortable. While I love to explore the city to find scrumptious food, I also like spending time in my room.

### Career Goals

My career goals are to work at a big name company (like Apple or Nvidia) and become financially free :)

### Interests

I like to play videogames, watching tv shows, and listening to a wide variety of music. Some of my hobbies include eating, cooking, and sleeping.

### Looking For

I am looking for someone who I can ask for help with anything related to school, whether it's about my major, events Drexel, and coops. I also would like my mentor to match my energy and brainrot humor and definitely like to be friends with my mentor!
