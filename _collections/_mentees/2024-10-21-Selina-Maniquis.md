### About

I was born and raised in the Philippines and moved to the US about 6 years ago. I like the city, so I love walking around. I also used to dance hiphop in high school, but i won’t necessarily say that I’m good at it.

### Career Goals

once i finish my bsn, i want to do pediatric nursing and work in NICU. After I got some experience, I want to study again and be a Nurse Practitioner.

### Interests

i like walking and exploring the city, getting boba, but also staying in and watching a movie!

### Looking For

I’m looking for someone to give me tips that could help me in my years at Drexel. I also want someone that I could hangout with and talk to!
