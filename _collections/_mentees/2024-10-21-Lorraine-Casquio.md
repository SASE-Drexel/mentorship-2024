### About

I get fomo so Iâ€™m always on the go, I talk alot (maybe), Iâ€™m funny (maybe). I grew up in the Philippines and moved here in philly about 3yrs ago now. I love the beach, the mountains, and roadtrips.

### Career Goals

I want to work in international business like in big hotel corporation.

### Interests

I like traveling, being involved in school activities, I want to start playing tennis or badminton or both. I like hanging out with friends alot and going to concert (i only been to two ðŸ˜”). Umm I read books too, sometimes :)

### Looking For

I need someone who is fun to be with but also serious enough to help me make the right academic and career decisions. Iâ€™ve realized that I get to be more myself when iâ€™m around people whose energy level is a little bit higher than mines.
