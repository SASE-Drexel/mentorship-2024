### About

Hi! My name is Clara <3, and I'm a second year law major with a minor in business law. I'm from south jersey. I would describe myself as someone who is super curious and I love yapping LMAO. I'm nice, and really enjoy meeting new people. I love laughing :) and spending time with friends. 

### Career Goals

I hope to be a lawyer one day. I plan to go to law school after getting my bachelors. I am not sure what type of firm or what type of law yet. I might add a minor in criminal justice just so I can explore everything I am interested. But I hope to figure out what type of law I want to practice by my 1L year. 

### Interests

Some of my interests include exploring cities and museums. I love arts and crafts (scrapbooking, painting, coloring, bracelet making, etc). A few of my hobbies are reading and going to the gym. I love learning about different social issues and enjoy volunteering. 

### Looking For

I hope to have a mentor whose nice, and someone I can yap with. Maybe someone who could give me advice or do homework with :) I am looking for a mentor to help guide me through the co-op process and help academically. I would love to have someone whose locked in so that it encourages me to lock in LOL.
