### About

I am from Pennsauken, NJ, and I commute to Drexel. My family is Bangladeshi, and I grew up low-income, being the only brown kid in my school. As a product of hardworking immigrants, I prioritize staying on top of everything, and I try to jump at every opportunity available. But at the same time, I can put myself first and take a spontaneous trip to NYC with my friends.

### Career Goals

Im majoring in mechanical engineering since it's the most "versatile," but that is subject to change. I want to explore different engineering disciplines, but, civil engineering is most intriguing to me right now as I've seen my brother's co-op experiences. In a corporate environment, I would a nice value work-life balance over a dream job, because I want to work to live and not live to work.

### Interests

I try to keep myself busy most days. Physically, I like to weightlift, play soccer, and bowl (I plan on joining a muay thai gym or the judo club soon). With my friends, I like to bowl, play pool, and find obscure restaurants. At home, I try to read books that immerse me somewhere else, right now I am reading Mother of God by Paul Rosolie.

### Looking For

Aside from having someone reccomend the best classes, and spots to study, I'm looking for someone I can ask a lot of questions and relate to. Coming to drexel, I found it really hard to make connections and network as I don't live on campus. I feel like having a SASE mentor will expand my view of Drexel, and open new doors for me that I have trouble opening myself.
