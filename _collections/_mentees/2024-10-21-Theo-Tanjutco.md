### About

I am a broke college student. In addition, I like to hangout with friends whether its going out to eat, going thrifting, or playing volleyball. I also like staying in and sleeping and playing valorant. I also like listening to music a lot, some of my favorite artists are bruno mars, d4vd, and daniel ceasar.

### Career Goals

I plan to get my bachelors in Computer Engineering and my masters in AI and Machine Learning. In the future, I hope to get a career at a tech company and make money.

### Interests

My interests include volleyball, basketball, valorant, and music. I also like programming, but I have been procrastinating and not gain too much progress in learning programming.

### Looking For

I am looking for a mentor to help with mostly careers/coops and academics, but also personal.
