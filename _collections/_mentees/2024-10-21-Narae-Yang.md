### About

Hello! My name is Narae Yang. I go by She/Her pronouns. I was born in South Korea, and moved to the Unites States when I was around 6 years old. I've been a Delawarian ever since. I would say I'm a hard worker (when it comes to my studies) but can get distracted very easily. My MBTI is INTJ, and my blood type is B. I've almost drowned 4 separate times. I am allergic to cats and pollen. I'm 5 foot 2 and a half. I've met John Fry once in my life, and one time my brother kicked my face and all three of my baby teeth fell out of my mouth. 

### Career Goals

I have plans on graduating with my bachelor of science in EE. After that, I would like to get some real work experience before deciding on anything else. I do have a goal of eventually going to law school and becoming a patent attorney. 

### Interests

I like cooking, baking, and eating food. In my spare time I like watching YouTube videos and playing video games. I also binge watch different shows, and I'm currently watching singles inferno. I play video games that aren't too difficult in skill level but wastes lots of time, like Stardew valley. 

### Looking For

I'm just looking for a mentor to maybe help guide me through maybe getting Co-ops/getting through classes. I'm also just looking for more connections and activities to do other that academics.
