### About

I'm currently completely lost about what to do with life and my major as a whole, so I'd really appreciate if I had someone guiding me through this weird process.

### Career Goals

No clue, but thinking of working with integrated circuits, processors and semiconductors.

### Interests

 I like reading, writing, baking and crocheting. Love long walks, and I'd like to leave near a beach someday.

### Looking For

Just someone that'll be patient enough for my cluelessness. I'll ask a lot of questions and it'll get really annoying, but that's just a reflection of how lost I am and how badly I need someone to help me through this. I also have anxiety and ADHD so those don't help my plight, either. I need someone to be understanding of that.
