### About

Second year Chem E international student (from JP)! I'm usually pretty reserved in group settings but I like meeting new people and exploring new places. I try to stay structured through the day but I usually end up going on a walk instead (or just anything other than sleeping igðŸ™ƒ)

### Career Goals

Donâ€™t really have anything specific in mind as long as itâ€™s reliable and I enjoy it. Leaning towards pharmaceuticals

### Interests

I go through too many hobbies because I like learning things just for the sake of it. Arts and crafts (sometimes), cooking (recently), gaming (depends on the day), getting boba (always) 

### Looking For

Looking for a mentor with good academic-personal life balance, and can give advice on coops and classes too. Iâ€™m definitely more of a listener so someone friendly that can be talkative would be nice :).
