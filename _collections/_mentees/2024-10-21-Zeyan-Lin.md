### About

I am a person who likes to meet new people and experience new things, although I also like to have dedicated rot time as well. I'm a socialable person as in my free time, I like to hangout with my friends in my free time no matter if it's for a trip to center city or if it's for a yap session. I don't really watch movies/shows but I'm a sucker for Studio Ghibli movies!

### Career Goals

Currently my careers goals just consist of being a software engineer and/or find the niche in CS that I would like to work in

### Interests

I like to make art, listen to music, go on long walks, hangout/play games with my friends !!

### Looking For

I'm looking for a mentor for mostly professional and academic reason. I'm hoping for a mentor who would be able to talk about their experiences and give advice both academically and professionally :)
