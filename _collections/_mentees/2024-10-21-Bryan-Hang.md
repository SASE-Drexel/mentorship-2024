### About

My name is Bryan I am a second year computer engineering major. I am a dancer in DKPC and a dance instructor for the club. I spend all my time sleeping and playing games and I take things as unseriously as possible unless I need to lock in emotionally or academically. 

### Career Goals

I want to go into some sort of IT field in which I help with majority hardware related issues because I love to be hands on with things.

### Interests

Dancing, gaming, Kpop, sleeping, rotting, bothering people to hang out with me

### Looking For

Im looking for someone that can provide me with entertainment, school and life advice, and someone that I can bother whenever. I want to be able to rely on this person for anything I need but also be someone they can lean on whenever they feel like can't be a mentor in the moment.
