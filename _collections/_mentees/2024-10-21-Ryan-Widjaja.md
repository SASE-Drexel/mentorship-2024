### About

I’m decently extroverted but I occasionally run out of my social battery. I’m also a self proclaimed academic weapon. I do a lot of self studying on the side and stuff like that (I still have a social life tho I swear 😭😭😭). I’m also super open to trying new things! I’ve been getting trained in volleyball and I’ve been looking to try badminton. I also love to meet new people. 

### Career Goals

I’m super career motivated. I’m looking into machine learning and pivoting into quantitative finance. Because of that, I’m actually looking to transfer after my second year to a quant target school 🙏🙏🙏😸😸😸😸

### Interests

I love to build keyboards! I’ve got about 6 boards. I’m also really into music and going to concerts. I’d say my music taste is very stereotypical (bea, keshi, CAS, chase atlantic etc). I also love the gym and collecting fragrances. I’m also looking into sewing

### Looking For

Personality wise, I’m pretty flexible. I’d very much prefer a CS major as I’d appreciate some mentorship when it comes to COOPS and projects and stuff like that. I don’t really have any preferences besides having decent academics so…
