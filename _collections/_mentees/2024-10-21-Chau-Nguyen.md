### About

I am a 1st-year of 4-years, currently 18yrs old. I am Vietnamese American born in the US, raised in Philadelphia. I am the type to laugh at anything slightly funny. I am quite reserved when first getting to know people, but I get more comfortable as time goes on. 

### Career Goals

As of right now, I don't have a clear goal but what I do want to pursue is a vocation in the priesthood. 

### Interests

I enjoy music (I'm open to any genre) but I mostly listen to R&B, Classical, K-Pop, K-Ballads, etc. I enjoy singing. I enjoy learning the piano. I enjoy cooking. I enjoy taking photos and vlogging my day. I enjoy skincare. 

### Looking For

I am looking for someone who can offer me advice both academically and personally. I want to hear about their own system of organization, study advice, work-student balance, etc. But I also want it to be a collaborative effort, when if possible, I can offer help as well. I also prefer a person who is more outgoing rather than strict since it'd make me less likely to reach out.
