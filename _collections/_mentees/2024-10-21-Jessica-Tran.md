### About

I'm a STEM oriented student, and I enjoy learning new things. I like to problem-solve and be challenged. I am more of an introverted person, but I can enjoy meeting new people and collaborating with others.

### Career Goals

I'm thinking of becoming a Software Engineer. I hope to work on innovative projects that will make an impact. 

### Interests

Some of my hobbies are reading, going on walks/hikes, and thrifting. I also like to binge watch shows (Grey's Anatomy, FRIENDS) and listen to music (Taylor Swift, Gracie Abrams).

### Looking For

I am looking for a friendly mentor to get some guidance from. I want someone who can give me advice on the co-op process. Additionally, I hope to have someone who took some similar courses to me so they could give me advice on my classes.
