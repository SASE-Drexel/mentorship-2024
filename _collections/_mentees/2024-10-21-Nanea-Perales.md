### About

Hi! I'm Nanea and I am a first year Bio pre-med major. I take pride in my academic achievements and always strive to do better. As a student I take my education seriously and find myself to be very driven and goal oriented. Outside of school I like to hang out with my friends and listen to music. I also enjoy doing little crafts and eating good food :)

### Career Goals

Right now, I want to become a Pediatrician. I'm unsure if I want to be in surgery, doctors offices, hospitals, etc.

### Interests

I like listening to music a lot! grentperez, w2e, rocco, beabadoobee, keshi, etc of that genre. I also like hanging out with my friends and making memories! I'm a huge fan of food :D whether that's eating or cooking/baking :)

### Looking For

I want somebody who is very grounded! I tend to get ahead of myself and focus on "what ifs" rather than what is in front of me and can overwhelm myself. I am also looking for someone who is respectful and open minded and not too focused on school (but still very academically driven) all the time as I am trying to figure out the balance between school and life outside of it being a freshman!
