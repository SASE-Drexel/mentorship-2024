about: Hi, my name is Anna Lu, and I use they/them pronouns. I am from Lansdale, PA, and have lived near Philly for most of my life. As a Chinese-American, I love visiting Philly’s Chinatown for bubble tea and pineapple bread. In my free time, I enjoy listening to music, thrifting, and trying new foods. I travel often and have recently been to Iceland, Norway, Belgium, and Japan. Over the summer, I climbed Mt. Fuji to its highest peak. It was super tough, and I'm so excited to never do anything like that ever again!

### About

Hi, my name is Anna Lu, and I use they/them pronouns. I am from Lansdale, PA, and have lived near Philly for most of my life. As a Chinese-American, I love visiting Philly’s Chinatown for bubble tea and pineapple bread. In my free time, I enjoy listening to music, thrifting, and trying new foods. I travel often and have recently been to Iceland, Norway, Belgium, and Japan. Over the summer, I climbed Mt. Fuji to its highest peak. It was super tough, and I'm so excited to never do anything like that ever again!

### Career Goals

I want to be an engineer, but I'm not completely sure what type yet. I am mainly interested in robotics and materials engineering, but I am also interested in prosthetic engineering. Additionally, I plan on minoring in computer science, but I have not officially declared a minor yet.

### Interests

I am interested in materials science and soft robotics, and I am currently doing research with a professor. Outside of academics, I enjoy playing violin in the university orchestra. I also have a background in martial arts and boxing, and sometimes try out Muay Thai and BJJ clubs in Philly. 

### Looking For

I'm looking for someone to provide professional and academic guidance, support, and insights. I will be applying for co-ops soon, and it would be nice to talk to someone who has been through the process. Additionally, I would like to get a chance to network with others in STEM fields who may have more experience. At the same time, I am also looking to make some friends and get to know more people. I'm hoping that by getting a mentor I can get more involved in SASE and at Drexel.
