### About

I'm a person who's always trying to learn and pursue things novel to me. I'm a massive foodie, a boba addict, and love almost all music (even country to an extent). Apart from that though, I'm from California, so I'm a west coast dude :p

### Career Goals

Want to be a physician, but haven't decided as to which specialty yet.

### Interests

I love playing Dungeons & Dragons, reading high fantasy, swimming, outdoorsy activities (hiking, stargazing, etc.), and some sports, namely soccer (Frankfurt) and some American football.

### Looking For

Professionally/academically wise I'd love a mentor that has went through the pre-med path, and can guide me on it. On a more personal note, I want a mentor who can be straight-forward and blunt with their feedback.
