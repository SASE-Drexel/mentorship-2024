### About

I am a freshman studying general business. I am really passionate about becoming involved with community service and a big advocate for student engagement. I love learning about psychology and economy. I am also a big math person too!

### Career Goals

My big end goal is to work at a firm on Wall Street, whether thats Goldman Sach or Black rock (etc.) I haven't decided. But for smaller goals, I just want to get to know more people (network), and level up my skills.

### Interests

I love watching cartoons, like the old disney shows or pbs kids (cyberchase, tmnt, powerpuff girls to name a few). I also love listening to music; I usually listen to pop music, and a little bit of kpop. My go-to right now is Chappell Roan's Red Wine Supernova.

### Looking For

I want to be able to expand my network and become more comfortable with interviews. I really want to be better at public speaking as well.
