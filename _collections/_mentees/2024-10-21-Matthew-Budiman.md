### About

i would say that a good short/concise summary of me is that i love photography/videography, going to the gym, hanging out with the people i love, and enjoying the little moments. 

### Career Goals

as i strive to become a Physician Assistant, my goal is to create a meaningful impact on healthcare and become a reliable provider that families can trust. i am still unsure on which specific area i want to focus on, but i find pediatrics compelling. The opportunity to care for children, especially those who may not receive adequate support at home, is incredibly fulfilling. knowing that i can contribute to their well-being and help shape the next generation is inspiring

### Interests

photography/videography, working out, anime, and kpop

### Looking For

just a chill mentor to be honest
