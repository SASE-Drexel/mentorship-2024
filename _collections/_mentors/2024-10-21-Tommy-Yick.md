### About

I am a 2nd year graduate student and it's my last year at Drexel. I got my BS in Mechanical Engineering and will complete my MS in Computer Science in 2025 spring. 

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I want to tell someone the things I wish I told myself when I was an underclassmen. 

### Career Goals

I want to be an cross-disciplinary engineer who has applications in both mechanical design engineering and software engineering. I love building things and giving them life and function and that's why I want to bridge those two disciplines together. 

### Co-ops

Air Management Services, Hillock Anodizing, Computer Components Corporation

### Interests

Designing things and seeing them come to life, robotics, astronomy. Fitness and competitive powerlifting 

### What to Expect From Me

Have weekly check-ins with them to see how they are doing and if they need guidance anywhere in life. Spend time with them 1-on-1. 

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

I hope to foster a long-lasting relationship with my mentee. I want to be able to have a huge positive impact on my mentee and set them up not just professionally, but in all parts of life. They'll basically be like a younger sibling to me.
