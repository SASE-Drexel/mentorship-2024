### About

I am a passionate student actively involved in my sorority, Sigma Psi Zeta, where I hold leadership roles and advocate for combating violence against women. I also enjoy organizing events like the Asian Night Market and participating in hackathons, which showcase my skills in web development and creative problem-solving. I have a strong relationship with my community and family. My studies include modern Japanese horror cinema, data structures, and web development, allowing me to balance academics, leadership, and community service.

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I would like to be a SASE Mentor because I want to get more involved on campus beyond the organizations I’m already part of. Mentorship is a great opportunity to share my experiences and knowledge while helping others grow academically and professionally. I also see it as a chance to build meaningful connections and further develop my leadership skills in a diverse and supportive environment. Being a SASE Mentor would allow me to contribute to the community while learning from the experiences of others. I believe I have a lot to offer in terms of my experience because of my two coops in SIG / Emoney and campus involvement. 

### Career Goals

My career goals focus on working in computer science, where I can apply my concentrations in Computer Graphics, Vision, and Interaction, along with Software Engineering. After gaining experience in the corporate world, I hope to transition into education and teach high school math and computer science, combining my technical knowledge with my passion for teaching.

### Co-ops

SIG , Emoney

### Interests

I have a passion for traveling and discovering new foods, with a particular love for hotpot and malatang. Cooking for friends is something I really enjoy, and I often experiment with different dishes. While I play a lot of video games, I tend to abandon them and switch to new ones each month, so I’m not especially skilled at any one game. Watching shows and movies is another favorite way I like to unwind. Some of my favorite shows and movies include Frieren, A Sign of Affection, The Bear, Decendents of the Sun, and Everything Everywhere All At Once. I also like to do my nails!

### What to Expect From Me

My mentorship would be a balance of guidance, support, and collaboration. I would focus on understanding my mentee’s goals and challenges, offering advice based on my experiences in academics, leadership, and personal development. I would also encourage them to step out of their comfort zone, whether it's exploring new opportunities or tackling challenges, while providing resources and encouragement along the way. My approach would be flexible, adapting to their needs while fostering a positive, growth-oriented environment. I could help them with their resume, mock-interviews, etc.  I would like them to be able to talk to me when they feel comfortable and be able to chat with them at least once a month :)

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

I envision a supportive and approachable relationship with my mentee, where they feel comfortable reaching out whenever they need guidance or simply want to chat. I’d aim to create a trusting environment where they can openly share their goals, challenges, and progress. We would check in at least once a month, allowing us to stay connected and maintain a consistent line of communication. My goal is to be someone they can rely on for advice, encouragement, and mentorship throughout their journey, while fostering a sense of camaraderie and mutual growth.
