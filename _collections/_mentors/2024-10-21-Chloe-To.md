### About

Hi! Outside of having a high screen-time I am a d1 bigback and a d2 badminton player. I'm an ENxJ (I switch between F and T depending how bad my week was). At Drexel, I’m part of the BRIDGE program as well as the Pennoni Honors College! I’m a Philly native - unfortunately - but if you need a tour guide I’ll be the best one you’ve ever met.

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I want to be able to guide others through obstacles I’ve faced in my underclassmen years. I value building a trusting relationship - a strong bond - much like the one I had with my upperclassmen friends who played a big role back in high school. I want to create that same supportive connection for others. By being a mentor, I can help others while being someone reliable they can turn to.

### Career Goals

I want to be active in front end development whether that be through becoming a director of a company’s UI Design or a frontend UX engineer. I really enjoy designing and combining that with studying user experience and development. 

### Co-ops

None

### Interests

I really love live music so I’ve been going to a lot of concerts and orchestra events! I’m an iPad kid and play CoD Mobile and DTI... My favorite food is xiao long bao but generally, I love to try new food despite having a list of 30 allergies. 

### What to Expect From Me

I would focus my mentorship on creating a relaxed and comfortable environment, avoiding anything too formal that might add stress. I want my mentee to feel at ease connecting with me, free from any pressure or concerns about my availability or being unapproachable. I’d look at it like building a friendship, fostering open communication and collaboration without any awkward power dynamics. My goal is to support their growth while making the experience enjoyable and a good learning experience for both of us.
