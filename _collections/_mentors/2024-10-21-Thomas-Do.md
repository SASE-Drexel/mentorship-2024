### About

I am outgoing and outspoken. I appreciate creativity and conversation. I think hard work is never unrewarded. I am not the smartest, but I will work hard to get myself to where I need to be. More than anything, I’ll match people’s energy. 

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I had a wonderful SASE mentor and he helped me a lot, I want to spread that knowledge and kindness. 

### Career Goals

I want to be a software engineer that can be placed in multiple roles. I want to job hop and eventually work for myself. 

### Co-ops

Comcast Business Role, Comcast Software Engineer, SIG Software Engineer

### Interests

Exercising, video games, cooking & baking, fishing, music of all genres, watching movies, anime, camping, cats, and sparkling water 

### What to Expect From Me

I would be there as a guide and as a friend. Being that I'm older and more experienced, I could also help in any technical and professional processes. I would like to plan things myself and cater to what their needs are. 

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

I envision being friends but also someone reliable that they can lean on.
