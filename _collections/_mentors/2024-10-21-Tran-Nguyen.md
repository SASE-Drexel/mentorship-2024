### About

Hey there! I’m Tran Nguyen, a senior majoring in Global Studies and a Philly native—so if you ever need a local tour guide, I’m your person! I love to chat (trust me, I can talk for days), but I’m also all ears, so conversations are always a good time. I’ve studied abroad in both Asia and Europe, so if you’re thinking about heading overseas, I’d love to help with your application. 

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I want to be a SASE mentor because I would like to help and give back what I have received from my time here at Drexel. I feel like I have learned a lot at Drexel. Everyone is always busy doing their own thing and does not necessarily have the time to help others. I want to provide that helping hand and make someone's journey through Drexel a little bit easier while also providing them with as many options and opportunities that they may have missed out on otherwise. 

### Career Goals

I am graduating soon so job hunting is on the top of my mind, but I have two routes I am looking to head towards. One would be to apply to be a diplomat of our country, to represent our country, and to help build working relationships. The second path would be moving and working for a company in NYC.

### Co-ops

Estee Lauder, Urban Outfitters, Blackrock

### Interests

I love talking about skincare and getting people to use sunscreen daily. I love it when my friends come to me for new suggestions or product recommendations when they face a skin issue. I also love eating and cooking, it is a great way to learn about new cultures and gain new life skills. 

### What to Expect From Me

For me, I would mentor my mentee by being a friend to them. I would invite them to events and try to get them out of their shells through interactions with my friends and others at the events. The biggest thing for me is that I want to be someone that my mentee can rely on and come to whenever they need me, whether that be for fun or for help, I'll be there. 

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

I envision my relationship with my mentee to be one that is easy-going and fun. I would like my mentee to see me as someone they can depend on whenever they needme.
