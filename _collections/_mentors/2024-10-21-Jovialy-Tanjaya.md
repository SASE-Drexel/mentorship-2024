### About

I am a second year Health Sciences major aspiring to become a PA. I am a Philly native and love to explore new spaces in the city. I play competitive badminton for Drexel's team and it is one of my favorite hobbies. I am a matcha girly!! and love to explore new cafes. 

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I believe I can help guide a mentee in their academic and social endeavors during their freshman year. As someone who changed their majors about 3 times and have been very anxious of my future during my freshman year, I want to provide the reassurance that you do not need to plan or have everything figured out perfectly.

### Career Goals

I aspire to become a Physician Assistant specializing in either Derm or Pediatrics. I love to work with children knowing that I will be apart of their adolescence. I am considering dermatology since is a specialty that combines both my interest in skincare/skin and the medical aspect. 

### Co-ops

None

### Interests

I enjoy being physically active whether that is playing badminton/tennis/basketball or just taking a stroll. Badminton is a hobby I am really fond of ever since I played in high school. Playing the piano is another one of my favorite past times. I enjoy listening to pretty instrumentals. 

### What to Expect From Me

I would have regular check ins to see how they are doing mentally and academically. I would establish their goals in the beginning of our mentorship and take each other into accountability through our regular check ins. I want to provide support and resources that I know and use to help guide them through the year. 

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

I would envision my relationship as their guide, friend, and supporter through their transition into college. I want to be a mentor that is also a friend that my mentee can rely on whether that is academically or socially. As a friend, I would hang out with them around the city and share our favorite spots. As a mentor, I would give them advice and reassurance for whatever doubts/struggles they may have.
