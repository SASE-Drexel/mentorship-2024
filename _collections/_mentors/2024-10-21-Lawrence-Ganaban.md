### About

Hi, I’m the Vice President of Drexel ASME and AIAA. I’m pretty involved with a decent amount of orgs around campus like FISDU and ASA, and I’d say I’m a pretty chill & laid back person i guess. 

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

SASE mentorship gives me an opportunity to help new underclassmen overcome the hurdles I did at Drexel, as well as in developing themselves professionally.

### Career Goals

I'm hoping to find work in the aerospace industry, preferably on next-gen aircraft.

### Co-ops

Manufacturing Engineer @ Curtiss-Wright; Student Trainee @ NAVSEA

### Interests

Video games, photography, volleyball, aviation

### What to Expect From Me

I hope to have mentorship similar to siblings, where my mentee can come to me with any questions, professional, class-wise, etc.

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

Older sibling-esque
