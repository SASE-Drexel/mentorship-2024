### About

I am an easy going person! I have lots of wisdom to share with the youngings. I like to joke around a lot and don't try to be too serious, even though my face might show otherwise. Overall, I just like to have fun!

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I was a SASE mentor last year and got to meet someone cool. I want to try again to see if I can do better and maybe meet new people.

### Career Goals

I want to start off strong at a good company and then job hop a bit. Want to build enough net worth to retire early-ish, and then open a nice little cafe somewhere :>

### Co-ops

Nuix, SIG, SAP

### Interests

Volleyball, gym, run, read (does manga count), video games, kdrama, kpop, and exploring interests

### What to Expect From Me

I would hope it's something relaxed. We would have a friend dynamic, yet I would be someone that can give them advice either in life or professionally. I'd reach out here and there to check in on them, and try to encourage them to get out of their comfort zone. And I'd try to guide them professionally, so hopefully they'd be someone in my major.

Or... I'd train them everyday. They would do 100 pushups, 100 sit-ups, 1km run daily. Then I'd give them a written test.

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

I envision us being buddies. Hangouts, either watching things, playing sports, trying restaurants, etc. Maybe trying new things together like sky diving or caviar. Yet, still being someone who they can look to for guidance and can rely on (I've achieved unc status).
