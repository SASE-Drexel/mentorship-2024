### About

I like to say I’m a down, chill to earth person. I love meeting new people and I’m a considered a grandma now :)

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I want to be a SASE mentor to help guide those younger than me. I enjoy helping others and getting to know new people. 

### Career Goals

Graduate (hopefully) and get a job in the healthcare industry

### Co-ops

Merck, Spark

### Interests

Going to the gym, drinking coffee, watching kdramas, playing video games, and frogs!

### What to Expect From Me

My mentorship would be like a friend. I would talk and hang with them. If they have any questions with anything, I would be more than happy to be there for them. 

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

I envision a chill relationship. If they need help or want to go out, I would be a text message away.
