### About

ISTJ if that means anything to you? But even though I'm introverted, I'm super friendly (pls ignore my RBF)! I'm also a night owl that loves playing tennis and listening to music. I also love trying new food and going cafe hopping so join me :)

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I want to be a mentor because I remember how scary everything was when I first started school, so I will be here for you (school and non-school related)!

### Career Goals

I like nice looking office spaces, and I love having great coworkers around. I also want money LOL

### Co-ops

Developer @ Apex Silver, Web Dev @ Society of Hospital Medicine

### Interests

I love listening to music on Spotify (let's make a blend together)!! I also love playing and watching tennis and very much miss Roger Federer being pro. I like watching dramas during breaks from school and you'll probably find me asleep anywhere tbh

### What to Expect From Me

We're gonna be great friends. I can (hopefully) help you with schoolwork and I've got plenty of old exams for you to use to study! I love having late night conversations (night owl things), but I will have a conversation with you anytime. And I will gladly point out places on campus for you to watch where you're walking before you trip like me TT

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

We're gonna be great friends. Let's hang out and grab food/cafe hop together!! I got you :)
