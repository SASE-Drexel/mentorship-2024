about: Hii there! As a Brooklyn native, I might come off as nonchalant, but I’m quite literally the opposite (pigeons freak me out). Still, I love exploring the city, doing work at cafes, and having late night talks by the pier. I'd say I'm relatively quiet in group settings, but I enjoy meeting new people and getting to engage through conversations and stories. I'm a creative thinker with a strong sense of empathy, but I’m also someone who follows through on my decisions.

### About

Hii there! As a Brooklyn native, I might come off as nonchalant, but I’m quite literally the opposite (pigeons freak me out). Still, I love exploring the city, doing work at cafes, and having late night talks by the pier. I'd say I'm relatively quiet in group settings, but I enjoy meeting new people and getting to engage through conversations and stories. I'm a creative thinker with a strong sense of empathy, but I’m also someone who follows through on my decisions.

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I remember what it was like to be on the other side, hoping to find a mentor for advice and support. I was fortunate to have someone help me then, and now I’d like to give back to the community by becoming a mentor myself. Building connections is such an important skill in any field, and I’d love to help someone develop those relationships in a supportive environment.

### Career Goals

My biggest career focus is in UX Design and Product Management. But down the line I would like to become a philanthropist and dedicate my time/savings to important causes. Otherwise, I'm aiming to retire early and travel the world

### Co-ops

None

### Interests

I love taking dance classes and used to be in a dance team for open styles choreography. I like collecting trinkets/blind boxes, building legos or 3D wooden puzzles, and taking pictures on my digi cam. Currently my Spotify repeats are rnb/krnb/indie pop songs from NIKI, Beabadoobee, Khalid, Jhene Aiko, Colde, slchld

### What to Expect From Me

I would like my mentorship to engage in open communication, and be focus on helping my mentee's goals in growth. I’d encourage them to take initiative and share any professional advice that deems fitting, but I also want to be there to help them navigate any obstacles they face. Overall, I’d focus on creating a safe space where they feel comfortable asking questions and building the skills needed to succeed in both academical and personally. I'd also be sure to connect them to anyone they need, like an industry professional.

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

I want to have a dependable relationship with my mentee where they feel comfortable sharing with me as much as they want. I hope to meet somewhat frequently whether it'd be to grab a quite bite or sweet treat and catch up. Or any time they need feedback and are seeking professional advice from me.
