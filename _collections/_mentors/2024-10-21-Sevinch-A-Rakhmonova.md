### About

My name is Sevinch, and I am a pre-med student super excited to be more involved in many of SASE's opportunities. I love cafes, doing pilates, playing tennis, cooking, journaling, and watercolor painting! I love exploring and traveling and taking pictures for memories!  I understand how difficult freshman year could be, so I look forward to giving back to the youth.

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I have many lovely mutuals at SASE and I believe that SASE's objectives align well with a lot of my values in making science more accessible and supportive for youth (such as the science donation drive and mentorship process). 

### Career Goals

I hope to ultimately get into a good medical school after undergrad and try to network as much as possible for an interdisciplinary experience! For my co-op in junior year, I hope to undertake a position at a biotech consulting company.  

### Co-ops

None

### Interests

Some of my favorite activities include hanging out with friends, reading a good book, exercising, or discovering new cafes in Philly. My favorite cafes would be Elixr and the french morrocan cafe called Sofi Corner. I also spend majority of my morning hours working on my research projects and volunteering at CHOP. I like to have a good balance of everything each week!

### What to Expect From Me

I would provide unconditional mentorship with both academic and non-academic support. I would try to not just be mentor and mentee but also friends!

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

I love having coffee chats, study sessions, and spending quality-time together in creative workshops at SASE. I know how tough freshman year could be so I am willing to be there for my mentee who might be struggling with their classes. I would also be willing to help them with whatever advice they need outside of academics as well! I also know that I can learn a lot from my mentee as well.
