### About

Hii! I'm Ben and I'm a 2nd year CS major. I have a ton of random hobbies like bowling and rock climbing and I really like to go out to eat! I'm a bit shy when I first meet people but always down to hang out and grab food or anything.

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I think it'd be fun to have a mentee. I had a lot of fun being a mentee last year and I think it'd be really cool to be able to support someone whether it be professional or just life in general.

### Career Goals

I want a high paying coop so I can big back :)

### Co-ops

None :3

### Interests

I'm a little bit of a nerd‚òùÔ∏èü§ì but I also like tennis, bowling, rock climbing, video games, gym, anime, munching, plus other things!!

### What to Expect From Me

It'd be more of a friendship and more laid backed rather than a strict mentorship. I would love to be able to help them anything professional/academically but at the end of the day I just want to be able to be good friends with my mentee.

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

we'd be super good friends :)
