### About

I’m a more extroverted person who likes finding new environments and experiences. 

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I’ve had many mentor figures I look up to in and out of SASE in my time at Drexel that have made me who I am today. I’d like to be that for someone else.

### Career Goals

Have a good job that challenges me and gives me freedom to do what I want outside of work.

### Co-ops

Lockheed Martin, Global Infrastructure Partners, Susquehanna International Group (SIG)

### Interests

I box and plan on fighting early next year. I run as well and enjoy middle distance races (<=5k). I like art, nice furniture, and good fitting clothes .

### What to Expect From Me

Depends on what the mentee is looking for. Also, depends on the mentee and what they are looking for.

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

Someone who I see eye to eye with.
