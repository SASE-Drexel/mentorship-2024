### About

Hiiii! I'm a New Yorker and a UXID major at Drexel with a strong STEM and visual arts background. I am an INFP and a great listener. If I'm not in my room, I'm eating tacos, attending live music events or thrifting. You also may see me in the gym or at Drexel Badminton Club practice.

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I've always loved helping people and I've had a great experience in the SASE mentorship program as a mentee. 

### Career Goals

I want to be a millionaire by 30, get a job as a UI or UX Designer, and adopt a cat.

### Co-ops

None

### Interests

I love to thrift and have been interested in fashion and collecting jewelry since birth. My Spotify is usually playing indie/rock/hyperpop and I've been to 5 concerts in the past 30 days. I also love making art, any crafts, and legos. 

### What to Expect From Me

My mentorship would be personalized, focused on growth, and guided by your goals and interests. I hope to form a mutually beneficial bestie relationship. Most importantly we would hangout :))
