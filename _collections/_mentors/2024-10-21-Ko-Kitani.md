### About

I asked my friends to answer this one:

“Always down to do anything, responsible, foodie, reliable, trustworthy, kind, sociable, diverse set of skills, gets along with anyone, active, and hardworking.” 

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I can spoil them :3 I had a mentor (s/o Angel Trach) last year who taught me a lot, so I’d love to pass down what I know and aid someone in any way I could, whether it be professional or just life.

### Career Goals

I want to work more in residential, more focused on sustainability. I’m not 100% committed at the moment, but that’s where I’m leaning as of now!

### Co-ops

N/A :3

### Interests

I like to run, play basketball, big back, play video games from time to time and hang with my friends. If I had money I’d blow it all on Legos.

### What to Expect From Me

Honestly idk, if my mentee wants me to be more involved I gotchu. If they don’t want to do as much and just need advice from time to time, that’s kewl too!

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

Idk I can pay for boba or something
