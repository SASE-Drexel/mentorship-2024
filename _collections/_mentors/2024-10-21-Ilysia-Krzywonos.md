### About

Hii, I'm Ilysia :) I'm a CS major from Bucks County Pa.  I love deep diving into random topics, playing music, and doing spontaneous things with friends in my free time. I am introverted but I would say I'm pretty open-minded and approachable. 

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

As someone who received a lot of great advice as a SASE mentee and found a great friend in my mentor, I hope to help contribute to the SASE tradition by sharing some insight with the new freshmen.  

### Career Goals

I want to work in research and development towards new technologies in the computer science field. I'm specifically interested in working with engineering and physics applications of computer science.

### Co-ops

(Current) Quantum Sensor UI Engineer

### Interests

I enjoy bingeing shows, traveling, learning random skills, music

### What to Expect From Me

I want to help my mentee work towards the goals they have set for themself by offering them guidance and resources when they want it. I would like to approach the mentorship as a friendship, offering the option of companionship and a friendly face on campus if that is what they need. I want to be able to address the individual needs of my mentee and create a comfortable space for them as they adjust to Drexel. 

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

I want to strive for an active friendship with my mentee; to be someone they can simply hang out with even if they are not always looking for advice.
