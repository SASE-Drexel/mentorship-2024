### About

Hi! I am a second-year studying computer engineering and was raised in Philly but was born in Vietnam. I'm pretty quiet and reserved and chill before you get to know me. I like to hang out and try different foods with people. I love laughing and making others laugh and cherish the quality time I spend with people.

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I believe mentorship is a powerful way to give back and to support others on their journey from my own personal experiences. I sometimes look back on my past and think of things I regret or would've done differently and would love to be a mentor so I can help my mentee as much as I can so they wouldn't have to on their journey. As a SASE Mentor, I hope to provide insights into both academic and personal growth, helping mentees navigate challenges and celebrate their progress.

### Career Goals

I aspire to become a computer engineer with mastery in electric circuit design, focusing on hands-on work that bridges software and hardware. My goal is to contribute to impactful projects while continuously improving my technical expertise and collaborating with forward-thinking teams.

### Co-ops

None

### Interests

 When I’m not diving into circuit design or coding, I love spending time baking, cooking, and staying active by playing tennis and badminton. I love being outside and going on walks and to explore. I love running errands with friends big or small as I believe it's the best way to know people. 

### What to Expect From Me

My mentoring would be focused on the mentee's individual needs and aspirations. I would start by learning about their interests and goals, and then offer regular check-ins, advise, and resources to help them progress. I'd assist them develop problem-solving skills, set attainable goals, and gain confidence in their abilities. My goal in discussing technical issues, career paths, or personal challenges would be to create a safe and welcoming environment for progress.

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

I envision a supportive, open partnership based on mutual respect and trust. I wish to create a connection in which my mentee feels comfortable asking questions and discussing their worries. My role would be to actively listen, offer critical feedback, and praise their accomplishments, resulting in a connection that fosters both growth and friendship..
