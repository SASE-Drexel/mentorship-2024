### About

Hello! Three words to describe me: awesome, friendly, nice. I'm a leo and enfj.

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I've been a mentee and chair, and I hope to give back to SASE by becoming a mentor. It is for sure a fulfilling experience to help someone else grow!!

### Career Goals

I hope to combine my creative skills + CS somehow.

### Co-ops

None

### Interests

I like to walk, thrift, buy purses, read, watch birds, play pickleball, drink matcha...

### What to Expect From Me

I hope to guide my mentee professionally, academically, and socially. I would want to be there for my mentee to lend an ear but also hang out. Yes yes I'd like to treat my mentee to food.

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

Awesome, friendly, nice
