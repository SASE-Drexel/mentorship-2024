### About

Hii, I'm Athela! I'm a short girl who laughs easily and has a friendly personality. I like sweet treats, reading books, and going to concerts. Let's be friends!

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I didn't think I knew enough stuff to be a good mentor last year, but I feel more knowledgeable now :D  I've done a lot to try and take advantage of my time at Drexel, so I like to say I have a well-rounded experience that could bring some good insight or offer guidance.

### Career Goals

My career goal is to help improve healthcare in any way using technology, whether that be on the data side, doing cybersecurity, or developing software. The ultimate goal is to be happy or retire early. 

### Co-ops

Comcast, American Association for Cancer Research(current)

### Interests

I love consuming content: music, movies, youtube, podcasts, books, a good yap session. I mostly listen to pop, k-pop, and soundtracks. I also enjoy getting a sweet treat with friends and playing games, like board games and Mario Kart.

### What to Expect From Me

I would like to help my mentee achieve their goals and give them support when needed. Whether it be for school, work/co-op, or socially, I'll help you out the best I can. Don't worry, I got you! PSA: if you do ask for help with your assignments, no promises on being able to help with that, apologies in advance.

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

Whatever makes you comfortable is fine with me! If you don't need a mentor for more professional guidance, we can just hang out and get food or something lol
