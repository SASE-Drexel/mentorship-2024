### About

Hey, I’m Betty, a sophomore majoring in User Experience & Interaction Design. I’m originally from South Korea, but I’ve spent the past eight years in California before my passion for UX design brought me to Drexel in Philly! In my free time, I love curating Pinterest boards filled with old architecture, interior design, and fashion. I’m excited to learn and grow through the mentorship program alongside this amazing community!

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I want to be a SASE Mentor to give back to a community that shares similar vision and goals as myself. Having benefited from mentorship myself, I know how valuable guidance and encouragement can be in navigating academic and career paths. By sharing my experiences, offering advice, and being a source of support, I hope to help others gain confidence in their own journey.

### Career Goals

My career goals include becoming a UX/Product Designer in the tech field where I can focus on solving complex problems with emerging technologies or products. I aim to work with a supportive and innovative team while continuing my freelance design work on the side.

### Co-ops

### Interests

My interests regarding my career path include reading articles, or personal website blogs on human centered and interaction design. In my free time, I love designing random graphic posters for fun, scavenger hunting for new music or jazz guitar tabs, and much more.

### What to Expect From Me

If I had a mentee, I would guide them on any questions regarding school or their career. While our career paths may look different, I would be very happy to share any resources, programs they can participate in, ways to reach out, ways to gain opportunities, or give a helping hand whenever they're in need of guidance or casual chats.

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

I envision my relationship with my mentee as casual yet respectful. As someone currently being mentored, I understand that unexpected questions or needs for help can happen. I would always keep a open communication line with my mentee to help whenever they need it. My overall goal for this program is to create a safe and encouraging environment where they can feel comfortable asking questions, exploring new ideas, and growing both personally and professionally!
