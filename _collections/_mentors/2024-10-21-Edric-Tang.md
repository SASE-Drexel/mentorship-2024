### About

I was born and raised in suburban Philly and I am a commuter! I am a gamer and tend to be on the unserious but I am a good listener and give good advice out. If you need anyone to talk to, I'll be there!

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I want to find a mentee with whom I could have a genuine, deep connection. SASE Mentorship has given me a mentor who neglects me, so I want to pick up a mentee and not neglect them. Also, it is an excellent opportunity to connect with others. 

### Career Goals

To make money and blow money. 

### Co-ops

im jobless (plz someone give me a job)

### Interests

Big backing, Gaming, Bowling, Wandering around campus and the city, Hanging out with friends. 

### What to Expect From Me

I would help them navigate Drexel, listen to their problems, give them advice, and guide them with their academics. 

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

We would be the best crime-fighting duo, I would be Batman and they would be Robin. We would also hangout, play games, and big back.
