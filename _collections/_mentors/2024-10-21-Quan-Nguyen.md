### About

i am very chill and go thru life light-heartedly. i am eager to try new things like food and fun activities! kind of a homebody but i still luv going out. monkeys and dinos = me.

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I want to be big sister!! I will treat my mentee and do anything my mentee asks. My schedule is free for you (future mentee)!! (i also need someone to play tennis w me)

### Career Goals

In the future, I would love to pursue cosmetic chemistry and work in formulating fragrance or skincare products. Pharmaceuticals is also very interesting to me, but I am open to anything specifically organic or analytical. Besides chemistry, I also wish to sew more ready-to-wear clothes and possibly even sell some pieces. Essentially, I just want a career where I can work with my hands.

### Co-ops

None

### Interests

lets play tennisssss!!!!! i acc dk the rules….i like good music, recently listening to little simz, beyonce, kaytranada, aaliyah, brandy. i luv walking around consuming nature. im trying to sew more clothes. i LUV LUV shoes. and good films. and good reads.

### What to Expect From Me

I want to help my mentee and be very reliable for them professionally and personally. I don’t want them overthink our relationship and want us to naturally reach out to each other with ease. If they have any questions or concerns, I got them. We will be great friends!! 

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

i imagine us on a sunny day at a cafe enjoying our food and drinks and talking about literally anything while we complete our work, weeks in advance.
