### About

I keep myself busy by playing for the club tennis team or just being involved in a bunch of orgs on campus. I’m currently on FISDU board as webmaster but formerly on ASME board as well. 

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

My SASE mentor has helped me out a lot and SASE itself has too. Just passing it on yknow. 

### Career Goals

Make money in the engineering field to buy food and live. Im trying to go into either aerospace or robotics. 

### Co-ops

None

### Interests

I play tennis, volleyball and too much valorant. I have a plant collection. I play a bunch of other videogames too. That’s about it

### What to Expect From Me

I would be there to answer any questions they have. If they have a similar major, i would guide them through all the classes I’ve taken. I’d talk to them about teachers to avoid/take or just general college things too like adjusting to classes or time management. 

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

Just hang out a couple times a term or something. Grab food or just talk. Relaxed and chill. I’m not the most active person in SASE so maybe partially text based if I don’t make it to some events.
