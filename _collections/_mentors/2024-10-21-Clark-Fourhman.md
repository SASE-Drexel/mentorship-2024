### About

My name is Clark Fourhman, and I'm a second-year software engineering student. I can be considered a massive nerd; I love watching movies, anime, and reading. I love drawing and you can usually find me where there's food or a good cup of coffee. 

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I would love to become a SASE mentor because last year's mentor program helped me fall in love with SASE and build amazing relationships at Drexel. Being a mentor would allow me to give back to the community, support new members, and share my positive experiences to help them thrive both personally and academically.

### Career Goals

My career goal is to work with a passionate team on user-based software applications, where I can leverage my skills as a software engineer or product manager. I'm excited about creating solutions that prioritize user experience, ensuring that our products not only meet needs but also delight and inspire users.

### Co-ops

None

### Interests

I have a strong passion for digital art and storytelling. I also enjoy thrifting for vintage tech, uncovering unique places within Philadelphia. Additionally, I love cooking and baking with friends. 

### What to Expect From Me

I'd check in regularly on how things are going at Drexel, sharing tips and advice from my own experiences. I'd help you with early CCI coursework, hopefully making those first classes a bit easier. Plus, I'd recommend some of the food spots Philly has to offer campus.

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 


I see my relationship with my mentee as a laid-back friendship. I want them to feel comfortable just hanging out and chatting about whatever’s on their mind, whether it’s coursework or something less serious.
