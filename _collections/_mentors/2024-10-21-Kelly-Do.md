### About

hi! I love meeting new people and getting to know them beyond the surface level. I love to eat yummy food, try new recipes, play roblox, hangout with others, and window shop (online and in person :p)

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I want to have a new bestie and pass my knowledge to them. I also want to be someone they can rely on if they ever need any help (personal or academic).

### Career Goals

I want to make lots of money and have a large network

### Co-ops

Aramark - IT Generalist

### Interests

meeting new people, trying new food, travelling, and securing a good paying internship (#leetcodeslave)

### What to Expect From Me

I would treat them out on our first hangout, be the shoulder for them to cry on or rant to, and the person they go to for academic help (to an extent!). pinky promise i'll keep in contact and we'll hangout often ;)

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

hopefully more personal rather than academic, but im okay with helping with school and ofc career!
