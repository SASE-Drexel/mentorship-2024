### About

i love cats and eating ice cream and spicy food! i enjoy attending social events, meeting new people, and making a fruit smoothie everyday. i also like feeding my gray cat chicken and apples.

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

i was in the SASE mentorship program as a mentee during my first-year. my mentor showed me how to explore more extracurriculars on campus and i got to meet new people along the way! i want to play a similar role and give back to the community.

### Career Goals

i want to become a software architect, so i'm currently exploring different roles in the software field

### Co-ops

Jr. Software Engineer @ WebstaurantStore

### Interests

hanging out + eating food with friends, playing tft, baking, dancing, traveling, crocheting, reading, digital art, shopping

### What to Expect From Me

if my mentee was in the same field as me, i would like to help them prep if it came to academics/coop and they want support in those fields. i would also encourage them to explore extracurriculars on campus and support them in any way they need. i like to plan/organize things ahead of time so i would share resources that may help them.

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

very casual and open like a mixture of friendship and mentorship!
