### About

Hi I'm Sanjana! I may seem introverted (INFJ), intimidating-looking, and super quiet in public but I love meeting new people, open up pretty fast, and (most importantly) will smile a lot more when you meet and get to know me. I drink too much iced coffee but have good recs on cafes to go get it or ways to make it. 

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

Drexel is a school that can be difficult to navigate on your own and I would've been really lost if not for my mentor, who provided me with a lot of advice and new connections. I'm actually more involved with SASE because of him! I also faced a lot of adversity that I learned and grew from during my time here and I want to provide guidance to those who need it, as well as preventing them from repeating my mistakes. Overall, I'd like to be a friend and immediate support system by being a mentor.

### Career Goals

Have a job and potentially pursue higher education

### Co-ops

Drexel CCI, Endo International

### Interests

I enjoy creative hobbies such as drawing and painting, making Pinterest boards, and baking occasionally. I also really like fashion (especially shoes with platforms) and makeup. My favorite types of desserts are both the fruit-based and coffee-based ones. 

### What to Expect From Me

Whatever they ask me or want to do, I'm down for. I LOVE giving advice to people, as well as yapping for no reason. I would definitely give them pointers on how to tackle Drexel academically, provide resume reviews and co-op advice, and also make plans to hang out if they're interested. 

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

I'd be an immediate support system and good friend to them :) I'd be there for them whenever they need me
