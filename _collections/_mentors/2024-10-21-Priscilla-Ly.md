### About

Hi I'm Priscilla :D INFJ, Minecrafter,  5'2 and a half

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

Since it's my last year at Drexel I want to pass down all the wisdom I've gained to the kids. Also I thought it would be fun

### Career Goals

I want to have a fulfilling job surrounded by good people and to make money to travel and eat good food

### Co-ops

Openforge, Comcast, Customized Energy Solutions

### Interests

I like to eat food, make food, and take pics of food (get food w me pls pls). I've been into gaming recently, but want to start putting that energy into learning the guitar again. I also like collecting blind boxes and spending my money on crane machine games.

### What to Expect From Me

I'll help with any advice I can give in academics and life. We can also just hang out and get boba and fight the ender dragon together.

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

I want to be a good mentor and a good friend :D
