### About

i'm quiet at first but i will warm up to you once i get to know you. i'm taking life like it's just another side quest. :)

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

i enjoy helping others grow and navigate their journey. sometimes you just need someone to push you through challenges and new opportunities, and i'd like to be that support for someone.

### Career Goals

i plan to take my FE exam soon and hopefully also find a full time job before graduating.

### Co-ops

D.C Beane and Associates Construction Company, AECOM, Jacobs

### Interests

i like to collect mini art prints, explore new places, drink matcha and go on walks.

### What to Expect From Me

relaxed and flexible. i just want to create a comfortable environment where my mentee feels safe asking questions or just chatting about whatever’s on their mind—whether it's career advice, personal development, or even life stuff.

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

chill & friendly
