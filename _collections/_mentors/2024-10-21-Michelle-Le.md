### About

I'd like to think I'm pretty chill. Fairly introverted initially but I open up pretty easily! Somehow always sleep deprived and craving naps. I'm a slight homebody but always down to hang out and grab food or anything :)

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I'm expanding my lineage :D but also I wanna make new friends and be a source of support for anyone who needs it. 

### Career Goals

I don't dream of labor but most likely a UX/UI position designing websites/apps or a front-end developer. I just want to sleep please. 

### Co-ops

Motion Graphics Animator @ MJH Life Sciences, Web UI Developer @ CSL

### Interests

I love cats- I can be your cat photos plug hehe. Drexel has taken away all my free time but I'm a creative so I like animation, motion graphics, video editing, clay, painting, arts and crafts, etc. I play games occasionally and indulge in anime/manga. I also love collecting cute trinkets like figurines, keychains, and pins to decorate with! I'm a fiend for anything strawberry and I love sushi.

### What to Expect From Me

I'll be there to talk about anything, whether it's about academics, career goals, or life in general. I'm a great listening ear :) also we can do fun hang outs, grab foods, share hobbies, do whatever! 

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

We'll be like this ðŸ¤ž-  besties or big sis vibes
