about: ESFP, if that tells you anything! I'm free spirited and lighthearted. Career driven. I like to keep myself busy. Spontaneous. I do little side quests for fun. Other than that, I don't do much but work, school, and some social events. I'd say I'm pretty athletic. I used to play a lot of sports (basketball, tennis, running, etc.) but nowadays, just here and there. I listen to a lot of pop, kpop, rap, rnb, and some edm.
