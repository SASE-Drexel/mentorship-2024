  <h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>I‚Äôm not sure how to describe myself, so I will describe myself from the perspective of a police officer describing me as a suspect:</p>

<p>Male, 19, approximately 5‚Äô8‚Äù, likely half Cantonese/Vietnamese, probably has a chinchilla named pancake as a pet, awful handwriting, a bit reserved as a person but enjoys quality time with friends</p>

<h3 id="why-do-i-want-to-be-a-sase-mentor">Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?</h3>

<p>I want to be a SASE mentor because having a SASE mentor when I was a freshman was such a welcoming way to start Drexel. I want to be a SASE mentor to make sure my mentee gets a good experience the way I got from my mentor last year. One of my regrets from last year was not spending enough time with my mentor, and I set aside plenty of time this year to spend with my mentee, to make it up for last year.</p>

<h3 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h3>

<p>My career goal is to work in robotics, I‚Äôm currently trying to BS/MS into EE/Robotics, and then try to land me a co-op at a robotics company (hopefully NASA) so I can learn how to work with robots :)</p>

<h3 id="co-ops">Co-ops</h3>

<p>Lockheed Martin (and kung fu tea)</p>

<h3 id="interests">Interests</h3>

<p>I really enjoy going to arcades (specifically round one), playing ping pong or tennis, going to EDM festivals, and playing games like csgo and osu</p>

<h3 id="what-to-expect-from-me">What to Expect From Me</h3>

<p>I would mentor my mentee through experiences. These experiences would be bringing them to organizations/clubs/places I enjoy or teach them skills that have benefitted me in life. I would also mentor them in academics, if they happened to major in STEM, though SASE mentorships isn‚Äôt office hours! My mentee wouldn‚Äôt need the same major as me.</p>

<h3 id="how-i-envision-my-relationship-with-my-mentees">How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s)</h3>

<p>Our relationship would fit my mentee, I will give them as much of my time as they desire or have time for. Though ultimately, I simply want to be seen as sort of an older brother figure to them. And by that, I mean as someone they can come to for advice as they need, or simply to hang/study with.</p>
