  <h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>I am an ISFJ/ISTJ. I am someone who is shy at first, but after a while, I like to talk and make jokes. I am someone who is a good listener and will always be there to give advice. I like to stay organized and am addicted to coffee.</p>

<h3 id="why-do-i-want-to-be-a-sase-mentor">Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?</h3>

<p>I would like to be a SASE mentor so that I could help them grow and navigate through the college life. I understand how overwhelming college can be at first, since I was in there shoes before. If I could help ease any uncertainties or worries, then it would be rewarding for me as I love to help others.</p>

<h3 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h3>

<p>I hope to become a data scientist or data analyst in the pharmaceutical industry due to my interests in medicine and helping others.</p>

<h3 id="co-ops">Co-ops</h3>

<p>Merck</p>

<h3 id="interests">Interests</h3>

<p>I love going to the gym and trying new things. I love hanging out with my friends and going to coffee shops. I also love to play video games and watch kdramas.</p>

<h3 id="what-to-expect-from-me">What to Expect From Me</h3>

<p>My mentorship looks like a regular friendship. I would mentor my mentee by giving school advice as I have switched majors before coming to love my major. I would also offer advice on managing stress, anxiety, and other emotional challenges. I would check up on them and guide them on anything they need help with.</p>

<h3 id="how-i-envision-my-relationship-with-my-mentees">How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s)</h3>

<p>I envision my relationship with my mentee as hanging out together whenever we have free time. I imagine us talking through text messages and/or Discord and getting along well. I hope I could bring small joys to their time here at Drexel.</p>
