  <h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>Hello Helloo :) I‚Äôm a pretty extroverted and open person and down-to-earth! I am also considered a grandma now so :D</p>

<h3 id="why-do-i-want-to-be-a-sase-mentor">Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?</h3>

<p>As someone with a lot of experience whether it‚Äôs academically, personally, socially, I want to be someone that my mentee to turn to for advice throughout their college and adulting journey.</p>

<h3 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h3>

<p>I want my work to benefit the community whether is aiding them or for sources of entertainment. I am interested in both front and backend engineering, so I would see myself doing full-stack work in the future.</p>

<h3 id="co-ops">Co-ops</h3>

  </tbody>
</table>

<h3 id="interests">Interests</h3>

<p>I like video-editing/photography (trying to start my youtube channel LOL), playing wordhunt (i have 1k+ wins), making spotify playlists, recording myself eat, watching kdramas and anime, collecting smiskis :))) I also listen to a good amount of EDM music - I am known to go to quite a bit of events :‚Äô)</p>

<h3 id="what-to-expect-from-me">What to Expect From Me</h3>

<p>I would be a easy-going and laid-back mentor to my mentee. If they ever have anything they need help with or are worried about I will help them the best that I can or find as many resources possible for them. I would mentor them in the many different areas they need.</p>

<h3 id="how-i-envision-my-relationship-with-my-mentees">How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s)</h3>

<p>I see my relationship with my mentee pretty laid-back and chill. I want to be like a friend that my mentee can reach out to from time to time whether it‚Äôs for help or just to hang out/talk and goof off. I also want to be someone they can turn to for insight or advice as new experiences come their way.</p>
