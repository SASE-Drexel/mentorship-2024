  <h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>I am generally a talkative person who really loves to learn new things. I am generally an outgoing person and one who is quite focused on my career. I also put a lot of effort into maintaining a lot of the good relationships I have in my lifetime and truly value the people who treat me well.</p>

<h3 id="why-do-i-want-to-be-a-sase-mentor">Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?</h3>

<p>I want to be a SASE mentor mainly because of my history as a SASE mentee. In freshman year, I found it difficult to make friends and have someone help me guide my career in general, but I found that SASE did a lot of those things. SASE greatly helped with a lot of the co-op process and got me the job I had wanted to get as well as I made so many great people I could learn from and befriended along the way. Being a mentor to me means giving back to the community and I would love to try to guide the mentees because of the fact that I was able to receive great care from my previous mentor and extremely meaningful relationships and experience.</p>

<h3 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h3>

<p>My career goals are to work on machine learning and utilize hardware to make useful and meaningful products that are able to be used frequently and are convenient to people. I will not lie I also want to make a lot of money in the future. A more short term goal is that I want to try to intern/co-op for a big tech company.</p>

<h3 id="co-ops">Co-ops</h3>

<p>Lockheed Martin: Advanced Technology Laboratory</p>

<h3 id="interests">Interests</h3>

<p>I am super interested in how stocks and businesses work as that is a hobby of mine and I truly find finance a very interesting and applicable subject to my daily life. I also watch anime, read manga, and play video games in my free time (typical engineering student LOL). I really love food, whether it‚Äôs going to NYC or out of my way just for food or cooking it myself, (should cook more often but my profession and career keep me busy :/).</p>

<h3 id="what-to-expect-from-me">What to Expect From Me</h3>

<p>I would want my mentorship to be really, as in I want our relationship to be a place where the mentee is able to be able to talk to me whenever they want. I would mentor my mentee in many different ways, whether they are in my major and I could their course work and different ways they prepare for co-op or, I could guide them to plan their career. I would essentially try to make an environment where they would be able to come to me for professional advice, personal advice, or even just to hang out and destress.</p>

<h3 id="how-i-envision-my-relationship-with-my-mentees">How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s)</h3>

<p>I envision my relationship with my mentee to be fun but meaningful. I want to be able to play video games with my mentees, hang out with them, and overall enjoy the friendships that we would be able to make. But I also want to help them be able to figure out problems that they may be struggling with, in or outside of classes and professionally. I envision that we have fantastic and great moments with each other, but that I am able to support them when times get tough and really help them get through what they are going through.</p>
