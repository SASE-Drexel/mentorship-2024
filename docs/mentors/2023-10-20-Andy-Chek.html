  <h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>When I’m not busy with academics, I enjoy binge watching YouTube or K-Dramas on Netflix. If I want to touch grass, I like to go on walks around University City or wherever and enjoy the hustle and bustle of Philly. I also dance to K-Pop for DKPC Prism (Girl Group multi-stan). Whenever the stars align, I love catching up with friends over dinner, drinks, study buddy dates, etc.</p>

<h3 id="why-do-i-want-to-be-a-sase-mentor">Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?</h3>

<p>Ideally, I hope to work with AI/ML fields that intersect with Sociology. I find observing human behaviors and how they interact with assistive technology (like personal assistants on your smartphone) interesting! In the short term, being a Software Engineer or Machine Learning Engineer would be a nice after graduation.</p>

<h3 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h3>

<p>I’ve been a member of SASE for my entire time at Drexel! From being a curious underclassman, spending 2 years on SASE’s E-Board, and now being an upperclassman full of both positive and negative experiences, I want to continue to give back to the organization that led to the connections I have today. I hope to impart my experiences to my potential mentee(s) and maybe be friends along the way :)</p>

<h3 id="co-ops">Co-ops</h3>

<p>Data Integrations Intern at Agilence, Software and Systems Co-op at Lockheed Martin</p>

<h3 id="interests">Interests</h3>

<p>My mentorship style tends to be more hands-off as I want my mentee to be able to stand on their own. I will be their #1 supporter in whatever life decides to throw at my mentee. With academics, I can help out my mentee with their coursework if they have a similar major to me. With life in general, I hope to mentor my mentee so that they learn a lot about adversity, fearlessness, and being content with themselves.</p>

<h3 id="what-to-expect-from-me">What to Expect From Me</h3>

<p>I’m a chill, nice, and outgoing graduate student who somehow ends up being a Teaching Assistant for every CCI underclassman in SASE. Wouldn’t it be crazy if you had me as your mentor? Click on me to learn more!</p>

<h3 id="how-i-envision-my-relationship-with-my-mentees">How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s)</h3>

<p>Ideally I would like to be involved in my mentee’s livelihood, but if they prefer me to not be, that’s fine as well. As a busy graduate student, I hope to still meet up with my mentee whenever it is possible. If they need any help with academics or even private matters, I will always be there for them. If my mentee is open to it, I would love to do some bonding activities on a regular basis (K-Pop concerts perhaps?).</p>
