  <h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>Hi I‚Äôm Sanjana! I may seem introverted (INFJ), intimidating-looking, and super quiet in public but I love meeting new people, open up pretty fast, and (most importantly) will smile a lot more when you meet and get to know me. I drink too much iced coffee but have good recs on cafes to go get it or ways to make it.</p>

<h3 id="why-do-i-want-to-be-a-sase-mentor">Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?</h3>

<p>Drexel is a school that can be difficult to navigate on your own and I would‚Äôve been really lost if not for my mentor, who provided me with a lot of advice and new connections. I‚Äôm actually more involved with SASE because of him! I also faced a lot of adversity that I learned and grew from during my time here and I want to provide guidance to those who need it, as well as preventing them from repeating my mistakes. Overall, I‚Äôd like to be a friend and immediate support system by being a mentor.</p>

<h3 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h3>

<p>Have a job and potentially pursue higher education</p>

<h3 id="co-ops">Co-ops</h3>

<p>Drexel CCI, Endo International</p>

<h3 id="interests">Interests</h3>

<p>I enjoy creative hobbies such as drawing and painting, making Pinterest boards, and baking occasionally. I also really like fashion (especially shoes with platforms) and makeup. My favorite types of desserts are both the fruit-based and coffee-based ones.</p>

<h3 id="what-to-expect-from-me">What to Expect From Me</h3>

<p>Whatever they ask me or want to do, I‚Äôm down for. I LOVE giving advice to people, as well as yapping for no reason. I would definitely give them pointers on how to tackle Drexel academically, provide resume reviews and co-op advice, and also make plans to hang out if they‚Äôre interested.</p>

<h3 id="how-i-envision-my-relationship-with-my-mentees">How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s)</h3>

<p>I‚Äôd be an immediate support system and good friend to them :) I‚Äôd be there for them whenever they need me</p>
