  <h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>I’m an outgoing person that likes to plan and go to club events. I’m on the board of ASME as event coordinator which basically means I’m in charge of making sure events are going to happen. I love trying new food and I regularly go to Chinatown for something good to eat. If I’m not out somewhere I’m usually inside gaming.</p>

<h3 id="why-do-i-want-to-be-a-sase-mentor">Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?</h3>

<p>When I was a mentee, it was really helpful having a upperclassman that has already gone through the Drexel process and can give me advice on things like class and co-op. I think that I can give that same experience to a mentee that was like me and could use that assistance.</p>

<h3 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h3>

<p>Do a good job at my co-op. Get a job after graduating.</p>

<h3 id="co-ops">Co-ops</h3>

<p>Stantec</p>

<h3 id="interests">Interests</h3>

<p>Gaming, reading, eating new food, going out to events.</p>

<h3 id="what-to-expect-from-me">What to Expect From Me</h3>

<p>Preferably my mentee would be the same major as me so I could help them academically. I’d try to give them advice on anything that they ask about ie. class, co-op, Drexel life. Also give them test and homework answers :)</p>

<h3 id="how-i-envision-my-relationship-with-my-mentees">How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s)</h3>

<p>It wouldn’t be super professional and we would just be friends. I would invite them out to events that I go to and just try to make their year fun.</p>
