  <h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>I would like to describe myself as an introverted extrovert. I like to keep to myself but if forced to be in a social surrounding I will try my best to engage in conversation or make jokes here and there. I‚Äôm a sensitive person at heart but I‚Äôm a very smiley person and can say random jokes spontaneously. I would say I am a very loyal person and try to be as reassuring and as loving as I can to others.</p>

<h3 id="why-do-i-want-to-be-a-sase-mentor">Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?</h3>

<p>I would like to be a sase mentor mainly to meet new people and fill in a big sister role to anyone boy or girl. I know my freshman year I wish I had someone I could go to and seek comfort or just laugh with easily at events and I hope to create a bond such as that in this mentor mentee process.</p>

<h3 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h3>

<p>My career goals are to become more confident within myself and trust my own work ethic. In the field of nursing it is extremely easy to compare myself to those around me but I hope to gain confidence throughout my time on coop and clinicals. I aspire to become a pediatric nurse (specifically in the ICU or travel nursing). I have always wanted to explore the world as I was restricted to do so growing up because of money and legal status. In the future I hope to make enough to have my family travel with me and make a different in little kiddos lives.</p>

<h3 id="co-ops">Co-ops</h3>

<p>Children‚Äôs Hospital of Philadelphia - Nursing Aid</p>

<h3 id="interests">Interests</h3>

<p>I‚Äôm a person who is very active at the gym. I swim and like to lift in my free time. I love kpop like g(idle), new jeans, twice, seventeen, and bts. I‚Äôm a foodie but I‚Äôm picky with seafood. I love exploring China town and going out spontaneously to Uniqlo or Trader Joe‚Äôs.</p>

<h3 id="what-to-expect-from-me">What to Expect From Me</h3>

<p>I would love to be a shoulder to lean on within this mentorship to not only go to for professional help but actually have a friend dynamic and to help one another force eachother out of our comfort zones to gain confidence and talk to new people as well</p>

<h3 id="how-i-envision-my-relationship-with-my-mentees">How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s)</h3>

<p>It does not have to be major related but I would love to help career wise whether it be with resumes or interviews, I want to be a trusting helping hand and friend. I want to be able to have a younger person to look up to me or just to share laughs with.</p>
