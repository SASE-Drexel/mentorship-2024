  <h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>I‚Äôm Drexel graduate starting grad school in Drexel again. I am old, and an international student from South Korea. I joke a lot, and love to discuss (yap) a lot as well. While I would consider myself an outgoing/extrovert, most of my hobbies are done indoors. I came to the States when I started High School, and I am somewhat confident in my English although I miss a lot of social cues and slangs. Lastly, I love to teach others, so feel free to reach out to me to ask about Drexel-related or even S. Korea-related questions.</p>

<h3 id="why-do-i-want-to-be-a-sase-mentor">Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?</h3>

<p>Anybody who has the similar hobbies as me or who loves to talk (yap). Not only would I love to meet those who I can talk with for hours and hours, but also I would love to meet people who draw or write fiction. But as long as you are a decent human, we‚Äôll most likely get along. Finally, the most important element of my life is to have fun and be happy.</p>

<h3 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h3>

<p>After my Master‚Äôs, I plan on obtaining my PhD under a different university. I am planning on putting my concentration in Machine Learning Engineering, and later become a full-time engineer with a PhD.</p>

<h3 id="co-ops">Co-ops</h3>

<p>1 (it was in Korea, I doubt you‚Äôll know of it)</p>

<h3 id="interests">Interests</h3>

<p>Non-Academic: Drawing/Art, Writing Fiction/Creative Writing/Poems, Cooking/Baking, Movies, Anime/Mango/Manhwa, Singing/Karaoke, Board Games
Academic: Math, Coding</p>

<h3 id="what-to-expect-from-me">What to Expect From Me</h3>

<p>Spending time with my mentee would be the main focus of my mentorship. During our hangout, I can help my mentee with Drexel stuff, answering questions, giving them tips, and even a few advices for coop. Moreover, I will probably cook for them a lot as well, as long as I‚Äôm able to use their kitchen :D</p>

<h3 id="how-i-envision-my-relationship-with-my-mentees">How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s)</h3>

<p>Healthy and helpful to each other. And most importantly, have fun.</p>
