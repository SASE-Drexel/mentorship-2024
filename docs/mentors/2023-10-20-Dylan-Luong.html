  <h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>I‚Äôm an INFJ-T and an old head at Drexel lol. I‚Äôve done a lot throughout my time here including 3 co-ops, 3 e-boards (GCC, SASE, PSP), and 3 majors. Safe to say, I‚Äôm an ambitious person haha, but I love to wind down and have fun!</p>

<h3 id="why-do-i-want-to-be-a-sase-mentor">Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?</h3>

<p>Going into my senior year, I want to help as many people and being a SASE mentor has always been such a rewarding experience for me. I don‚Äôt expect to be paired up or anything (especially since I already have mentees from previous years so I don‚Äôt want to take the opportunity away from anyone), but I just want to be an option for people.</p>

<h3 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h3>

<p>I‚Äôd hope to work at a large financial institution doing marketing or consulting. I also see myself jumping around different careers and not just sticking to one thing.</p>

<h3 id="co-ops">Co-ops</h3>

<p>KKR, Chubb, J.P. Morgan</p>

<h3 id="interests">Interests</h3>

<p>I find myself going to the DAC a lot to workout, go on a run, play squash, ping pong, or even shoot around at the basketball courts. I‚Äôm a big fan of Marvel movies, going to Costco, and the 76ers. I also enjoy photography and watching youtube videos while eating food.</p>

<h3 id="what-to-expect-from-me">What to Expect From Me</h3>

<p>I‚Äôm always going to be super supportive of my mentees and be there for them whenever they need me. I usually like to let the mentees determine what sort of mentorship they‚Äôre looking for, whether they are seeking professional advice or simply just a new friend on campus. I‚Äôm easily accessible via text and love to attend mentorship events or just hang out whenever.</p>

<h3 id="how-i-envision-my-relationship-with-my-mentees">How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s)</h3>

<p>I see the relationship being pretty chill. I like catching up with my mentees and seeing them around campus and at events.</p>
