  <h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>I am Filipino-American who was born and raised in Yonkers, NY. I came to Philly to go to college at Drexel and I found myself getting to know a lot of people in the college and other Philly colleges. I am someone who enjoys being out a lot and learning a lot of new things. I feel like I‚Äôm very athletic and I‚Äôm pretty active on a day to day life where I would love going outside. I am very caring, I love talking to people, and I feel like I do a lot of activities. I‚Äôm basically down to do anything that seems fun like go sky diving :) or do some other crazy enjoyable things.</p>

<h3 id="why-do-i-want-to-be-a-sase-mentor">Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?</h3>

<p>I would love to be a SASE Mentor because I feel like I would be a really fun mentor be around! I love hanging out and I feel like I would love to be getting to know my mentee more.</p>

<h3 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h3>

<p>My career goals are to go work for a sports company or entertainment company(film/television/games). I really enjoy being in the design field with drawing/sketching and creating graphics for social media.</p>

<h3 id="co-ops">Co-ops</h3>

<h3 id="interests">Interests</h3>

<p>I LOVE VOLLEYBALL! I also like other sports like swimming, pickleball, lacrosse, basketball and badminton. I‚Äôm also very creative by doing photography, painting, sketching, song writing, playing 5 instruments, and singing. I dance for FISDU‚Äôs barrio and im in hip hop class right now. I find myself drawing a lot when im alone and listening to music at the same time.</p>

<h3 id="what-to-expect-from-me">What to Expect From Me</h3>

<p>I would want to guide my mentor with any questions that they have regarding school, campus culture, going to different orgs (like fisdu), and help them with any day life problems. I don‚Äôt mind being in a different major than them, but it would be cool if their westphal. However! My entire Lin is like not westphal lol, so honestly I would just like to help them with anything that they need!</p>

<h3 id="how-i-envision-my-relationship-with-my-mentees">How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s)</h3>

<p>I would want to hang out with my mentee every now and then. I do want to still keep in contact a good amount and possibly want to play sports with them :) like volleyball.</p>
