  <h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>Hihi, I‚Äôm Terie! I like to think I‚Äôm a pretty outgoing person and I always love meeting new people! I‚Äôm always hanging around at events, so if you‚Äôre ever looking for someone to share dad jokes and bad puns with, a carpool karaoke buddy, or just a listening ear, I gotchu ;)</p>

<h3 id="why-do-i-want-to-be-a-sase-mentor">Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?</h3>

<p>I remember feeling so uncertain and lost during my freshman year, and my mentor was someone who helped me out a lot and guided me through. Being a SASE mentee was one of my favorite experiences so far in college, and I want to be able to provide that for my mentee! I want to be a friend to my mentee, someone they can count on to support, advise, and just spend time with them!</p>

<h3 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h3>

<p>I‚Äôm still figuring out exactly what I want to do in the field of tech, but I ultimately just want a career where I can constantly learn and grow and try new things without feeling like I‚Äôm stuck in one place.</p>

<h3 id="co-ops">Co-ops</h3>

<p>Asset Health Analyst at PECO, Solutions Architect Analyst at LSAC</p>

<h3 id="interests">Interests</h3>

<p>I love spending time with people and going on spontaneous adventures! I‚Äôm definitely a huge foodie so I‚Äôm always down to explore and go out on food/boba dates :)) I also spend way too much time on TikTok and am currently rewatching Friends for the third time, so I‚Äôll always accept show recs!</p>

<h3 id="what-to-expect-from-me">What to Expect From Me</h3>

<p>Definitely more of a friendship/older sibling vibe, the most important part of being a mentor is just being there for my mentee whenever they need me! I want to make sure that they know I‚Äôm always there for them by checking in on them, giving them advice, and going on plenty of mentor-mentee bonding dates :)</p>

<h3 id="how-i-envision-my-relationship-with-my-mentees">How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s)</h3>

<p>Very lighthearted and fun for sure! I want my mentee to feel comfortable coming to me as a friend for anything, whether it be personal or professional. We can talk about classes and co-ops, rant about life, send each other TikToks, or just hang out and grab food :D</p>
