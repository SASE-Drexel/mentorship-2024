  <h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>I am a current second year who is studying Management Information Systems with a minor in UI/UX. I am born and raised in Philly and love meeting new people :-)</p>

<h3 id="why-do-i-want-to-be-a-sase-mentor">Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?</h3>

<p>I would like to be a mentor because as someone that received tons of help when I was a freshman, I would like to do the same for someone that will need it! I hope to be able to be a guiding hand for anyone that is struggling with a new transition into college :D</p>

<h3 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h3>

<p>I hope to be able to either work somewhere along the lines of being a project manager!</p>

<h3 id="co-ops">Co-ops</h3>

<p>None</p>

<h3 id="interests">Interests</h3>

<p>Outside of school, I work at 2 ice rinks, City Hall Ice Rink and UPenn Ice Rink! I love to bake, take photos/videos w my camera, spend time with people (even if its just us doing our work), and eating :) I am also the head manager for Drexel Ice Hockey so I will be around them and the ice rink often during hockey season.</p>

<h3 id="what-to-expect-from-me">What to Expect From Me</h3>

<p>I will always be a text or a call away! We can meet up to study together, eat together, and go on trips too! I am always down to do anything whenever I‚Äôm available, explore, thrift, eat, etc etc!</p>

<h3 id="how-i-envision-my-relationship-with-my-mentees">How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s)</h3>

<p>Whatever you‚Äôd want it to be! Doesn‚Äôt have to be just professional, we can hang out whenever and spend time getting to know each other through many other things, while also being a mentor-mentee</p>
