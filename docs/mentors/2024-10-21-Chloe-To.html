  <h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>Hi! Outside of having a high screen-time I am a d1 bigback and a d2 badminton player. I‚Äôm an ENxJ (I switch between F and T depending how bad my week was). At Drexel, I‚Äôm part of the BRIDGE program as well as the Pennoni Honors College! I‚Äôm a Philly native - unfortunately - but if you need a tour guide I‚Äôll be the best one you‚Äôve ever met.</p>

<h3 id="why-do-i-want-to-be-a-sase-mentor">Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?</h3>

<p>I want to be able to guide others through obstacles I‚Äôve faced in my underclassmen years. I value building a trusting relationship - a strong bond - much like the one I had with my upperclassmen friends who played a big role back in high school. I want to create that same supportive connection for others. By being a mentor, I can help others while being someone reliable they can turn to.</p>

<h3 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h3>

<p>I want to be active in front end development whether that be through becoming a director of a company‚Äôs UI Design or a frontend UX engineer. I really enjoy designing and combining that with studying user experience and development.</p>

<h3 id="co-ops">Co-ops</h3>

<p>None</p>

<h3 id="interests">Interests</h3>

<p>I really love live music so I‚Äôve been going to a lot of concerts and orchestra events! I‚Äôm an iPad kid and play CoD Mobile and DTI‚Ä¶ My favorite food is xiao long bao but generally, I love to try new food despite having a list of 30 allergies.</p>

<h3 id="what-to-expect-from-me">What to Expect From Me</h3>

<p>I would focus my mentorship on creating a relaxed and comfortable environment, avoiding anything too formal that might add stress. I want my mentee to feel at ease connecting with me, free from any pressure or concerns about my availability or being unapproachable. I‚Äôd look at it like building a friendship, fostering open communication and collaboration without any awkward power dynamics. My goal is to support their growth while making the experience enjoyable and a good learning experience for both of us.</p>

<h3 id="how-i-envision-my-relationship-with-my-mentees">How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s)</h3>

<p>I would focus my mentorship on creating a relaxed and comfortable environment, avoiding anything too formal that might add stress.
