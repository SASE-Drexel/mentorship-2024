  <h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>I think I’m pretty quiet upon first impression. But I’m more talkative and open once I get comfortable with people. I think really open minded and empathetic. I like to say that if I want something to get done, I will get it done. I think I’m someone that stays from start to finish with their goals.</p>

<h3 id="why-do-i-want-to-be-a-sase-mentor">Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?</h3>

<p>I want to be a Mentor because I’m the oldest child of a first generation immigrant family. A lot of my life I was navigating my academic and professional goals by myself and often wished I had someone older and more experienced to help me. I want to be able to help someone else in their own journey, and provide them with the guidance and resources that I wish I knew/had going into and at the beginning of college. I also want to be a more active member in the org so hopefully this helps.</p>

<h3 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h3>

<p>Data Engineer at Spotify! is a goal for some point in the future. I don’t really have any specific plans, I’ll probably work as Software Engineer. I haven’t really figured out what industry specifically but I know at some point when I’m old I want to own a flower shop :)</p>

<h3 id="co-ops">Co-ops</h3>

<p>Wharton - Jr Research Programmer, IT Support Specialist</p>

<h3 id="interests">Interests</h3>

<p>I like working out. I like exploring new places, even if its something small like a coffee shop. I like baking, I think I have a big sweet tooth. I occasionally play video games (Genshin and Val mostly). My favorite anime is Inuyasha.</p>

<h3 id="what-to-expect-from-me">What to Expect From Me</h3>

<p>I think my mentorship would depend on my mentee and their goals. Of course, I want to be able to guide my mentee professionally and academically. I would help them when I can. However, for areas that I fall short in I would utilize my network and connections. For example, if they want to do their co-op at a company I have no idea about, I would ask around if people had their co-op there. I would try my best to be someone they can look up to and rely on. However, I know that while I’m a mentor, I’m also human :)</p>

<h3 id="how-i-envision-my-relationship-with-my-mentees">How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s)</h3>

<p>I really hope we can be friends, that we would be able to hang out often. But that’s fine if doesn’t work out that way. I hope we would be comfortable enough with each other that they wouldn’t be hesitant to come to me and ask me questions. I’m okay with either a high or low maintenance relationship with my mentee.</p>
