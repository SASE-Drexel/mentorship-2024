  <h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>Hi! I am a second-year studying computer engineering and was raised in Philly but was born in Vietnam. I‚Äôm pretty quiet and reserved and chill before you get to know me. I like to hang out and try different foods with people. I love laughing and making others laugh and cherish the quality time I spend with people.</p>

<h3 id="why-do-i-want-to-be-a-sase-mentor">Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?</h3>

<p>I believe mentorship is a powerful way to give back and to support others on their journey from my own personal experiences. I sometimes look back on my past and think of things I regret or would‚Äôve done differently and would love to be a mentor so I can help my mentee as much as I can so they wouldn‚Äôt have to on their journey. As a SASE Mentor, I hope to provide insights into both academic and personal growth, helping mentees navigate challenges and celebrate their progress.</p>

<h3 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h3>

<p>I aspire to become a computer engineer with mastery in electric circuit design, focusing on hands-on work that bridges software and hardware. My goal is to contribute to impactful projects while continuously improving my technical expertise and collaborating with forward-thinking teams.</p>

<h3 id="co-ops">Co-ops</h3>

<p>None</p>

<h3 id="interests">Interests</h3>

<p>When I‚Äôm not diving into circuit design or coding, I love spending time baking, cooking, and staying active by playing tennis and badminton. I love being outside and going on walks and to explore. I love running errands with friends big or small as I believe it‚Äôs the best way to know people.</p>

<h3 id="what-to-expect-from-me">What to Expect From Me</h3>

<p>My mentoring would be focused on the mentee‚Äôs individual needs and aspirations. I would start by learning about their interests and goals, and then offer regular check-ins, advise, and resources to help them progress. I‚Äôd assist them develop problem-solving skills, set attainable goals, and gain confidence in their abilities. My goal in discussing technical issues, career¬†paths, or personal challenges would be to create a safe and welcoming environment for progress.</p>

<h3 id="how-i-envision-my-relationship-with-my-mentees">How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s)</h3>

<p>I envision¬†a supportive, open partnership based on mutual respect and trust. I wish to create a connection in which my mentee feels comfortable asking questions and discussing their worries. My role would be to actively listen, offer critical feedback, and praise their accomplishments, resulting in a connection¬†that fosters both growth and friendship..</p>
