  <h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>Unlike what by RBF gives off, I am actually super friendly night owl (just very easily intimidated by people). I‚Äôm pretty quiet and shy at first, but they keywords are definitely at first. Also unlike what people say, I do touch grass!! If you don‚Äôt see me taking a nap somewhere (and anywhere) on campus, you‚Äôll probably find me listening to music or crying over the fact that my code is broken TT</p>

<h3 id="why-do-i-want-to-be-a-sase-mentor">Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?</h3>

<p>I want to be a SASE mentor because I remember how scary it is to be an underclassmen (idk how I made it to my 3rd year). And it‚Äôs so much more comforting to see a familiar face around and have someone to talk to/go to for advice. Also I had a super cool mentor who happens to be your president</p>

<h3 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h3>

<p>As a CS major, I‚Äôm still exploring my career options. I like office settings, and I‚Äôm using each co-op to test out different positions and different sized companies.</p>

<h3 id="co-ops">Co-ops</h3>

<p>Apex Silver</p>

<h3 id="interests">Interests</h3>

<p>I love listening to music (we can make a blend and plenty of playlists together on Spotify)!! People mainly associate me with Spotify or sleep LOL. I also enjoy playing and watching tennis, as well as watching dramas during non-academic times. I also love hunting for good food places!!</p>

<h3 id="what-to-expect-from-me">What to Expect From Me</h3>

<p>I hope you trust me and that we become friends!! I can (possibly) help you with schoolwork if you need it (and I save old exams so I got you). We can always have deep convos about life too cause that‚Äôs always fun in the middle of the night. Oh, and I got you covered on how to NOT end up in the ER if you ever live in Summit in your future LMAO. And I also got you covered on where to watch for dips/cracks in the sidewalk</p>

<h3 id="how-i-envision-my-relationship-with-my-mentees">How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s)</h3>

<p>We‚Äôre about to be the greatest of friends. Let‚Äôs hangout and grab food together!! If you need any advice, I got you :)</p>
