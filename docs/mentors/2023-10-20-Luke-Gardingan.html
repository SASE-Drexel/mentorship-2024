  <h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>I‚Äôm a third year mechanical engineer that‚Äôs currently taking steps to have a career in public transit. I choose to go to Drexel because I want to live in a big city while not being too far from home. I live in Mantua and commute to campus whenever needed and I enjoy driving around in the city despite it being Philly.</p>

<h3 id="why-do-i-want-to-be-a-sase-mentor">Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?</h3>

<p>I want to provide resources and expertise to those younger than me that I wish I had when I first entered Drexel. While the COOP 101 class is a good foundation, I think professional development can be substantially improved upon on campus such as the need for networking, improving resumes, and just generally what to look for in a job. There‚Äôs also the academic side as well. Having someone who took the class and being able to tell you what to expect is a big benefit in addition to tutoring help.</p>

<h3 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h3>

<p>To be able to manage a team that‚Äôs cohesive and enjoyable. Working on projects that I enjoy and see from start to finish would be a plus.</p>

<h3 id="co-ops">Co-ops</h3>

<p>Rhoads Industries-Project Manager/Engineer, STV Project Engineer</p>

<h3 id="interests">Interests</h3>

<p>I‚Äôm big into thrifting and shopping. I‚Äôve also been trying to improve my cooking skills as well now that I have moved off-campus. I also just enjoy going around the city and doing urban exploration.</p>

<h3 id="what-to-expect-from-me">What to Expect From Me</h3>

<p>Personally, mentorship would have three steps. First, identity goals/wants (ex. good coop job) Second, set a series of deliverables and steps to take (ex. network, improve resume, etc.) Third, follow up on steps and how they were achieved (ex. met with professionals in the field). Overall, I‚Äôd mange it much like an engineering project and when things fall through, see how it can be avoided in the future and improve for the better.</p>

<h3 id="how-i-envision-my-relationship-with-my-mentees">How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s)</h3>

<p>I‚Äôd want my relationship to be more of friendship. The professional world is filled with drab characters and I wouldn‚Äôt want to be that for my mentee. I‚Äôd want to be someone they can come and talk to regarding any issues, whether it be academical, professional, or social. Ultimately, keep it chill.</p>
