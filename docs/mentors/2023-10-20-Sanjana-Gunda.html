  <h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>Hi, I’m Sanjana! While I initially seem intimidating and super shy (New Jeans reference not intended), I love meeting and interacting with new people a lot. I’m pretty goal-oriented and take my work seriously, but I love going out to get food or doing anything fun when it’s the weekend.</p>

<h3 id="why-do-i-want-to-be-a-sase-mentor">Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?</h3>

<p>The mentorship program made my freshman year more fun than it initially was. As a result, I have a lot of wisdom to pass onto others so that they can have an enjoyable year and avoid making the same mistakes as I did last year. Also, I love making new friends and I would like to give my mentee someone they can rely on for help.</p>

<h3 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h3>

<p>Overall, I want to work at a well-known company and live a comfortable life. In the near future, however, I’m interested in pursuing a Masters degree.</p>

<h3 id="co-ops">Co-ops</h3>

<p>Eurofins Agroscience Services</p>

<h3 id="interests">Interests</h3>

<p>I like doing arts and crafts, making Pinterest boards, and learning new skills. I also really like anything strawberry related.</p>

<h3 id="what-to-expect-from-me">What to Expect From Me</h3>

<p>I’d basically be their friend and act as a support system any time they need it. I’m down to look over their resume and give mock interviews or help them with their subjects, but if they’re too burnt out, I’m down to go get coffee instead :)</p>

<h3 id="how-i-envision-my-relationship-with-my-mentees">How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s)</h3>

<p>We’d be good friends and do things related to and outside of academics and professional tasks. I’ll basically help them and give them the advice they need. I also think it’s important to have fun every once in a while, so we could hang out and do things unrelated to schoolwork.</p>
