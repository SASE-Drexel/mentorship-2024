  <h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>Hii, I‚Äôm Ilysia :) I‚Äôm a CS major from Bucks County Pa.  I love deep diving into random topics, playing music, and doing spontaneous things with friends in my free time. I am introverted but I would say I‚Äôm pretty open-minded and approachable.</p>

<h3 id="why-do-i-want-to-be-a-sase-mentor">Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?</h3>

<p>As someone who received a lot of great advice as a SASE mentee and found a great friend in my mentor, I hope to help contribute to the SASE tradition by sharing some insight with the new freshmen.</p>

<h3 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h3>

<p>I want to work in research and development towards new technologies in the computer science field. I‚Äôm specifically interested in working with engineering and physics applications of computer science.</p>

<h3 id="co-ops">Co-ops</h3>

<p>(Current) Quantum Sensor UI Engineer</p>

<h3 id="interests">Interests</h3>

<p>I enjoy bingeing shows, traveling, learning random skills, music</p>

<h3 id="what-to-expect-from-me">What to Expect From Me</h3>

<p>I want to help my mentee work towards the goals they have set for themself by offering them guidance and resources when they want it. I would like to approach the mentorship as a friendship, offering the option of companionship and a friendly face on campus if that is what they need. I want to be able to address the individual needs of my mentee and create a comfortable space for them as they adjust to Drexel.</p>

<h3 id="how-i-envision-my-relationship-with-my-mentees">How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s)</h3>

<p>I want to strive for an active friendship with my mentee; to be someone they can simply hang out with even if they are not always looking for advice.</p>
