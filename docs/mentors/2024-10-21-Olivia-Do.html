  <h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>Hello! I am a pre-junior majoring in cybersecurity (computing and security technology). I‚Äôm the Treasurer for the Women in Computing Society for the 24-25 academic year. I‚Äôm also a part of FISDU, a peer mentor for the FYES program, and I do intramural volleyball!</p>

<h3 id="why-do-i-want-to-be-a-sase-mentor">Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?</h3>

<p>I love mentoring! I love giving back to the community, and more importantly, I love talking about myself (jk) (not really)</p>

<h3 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h3>

<p>I‚Äôm interested in ethical hacking and penetration testing. I‚Äôm also interested in data science co-ops in addition to security engineer co-ops. Not sure yet what I want to do but I want to explore these.</p>

<h3 id="co-ops">Co-ops</h3>

<p>Tokio Marine North America Services, Systems Administrator Co-op</p>

<h3 id="interests">Interests</h3>

<p>I love going to the gym, playing volleyball, going out to eat, going out with friends, listening to music, etc. I‚Äôm a huge foodie and boba lover and I love getting food in chinatown (boba, korean fried chicken, dessert). Some of my favorite food places in philly are Mango Mango, Tsaocaa, chicha san chen, bonchon, etc. I‚Äôm very interested in cybersecurity and ethical hacking! I also like watching shows, naps, and occasionally, when I have time, gaming.</p>

<h3 id="what-to-expect-from-me">What to Expect From Me</h3>

<p>Provide them with resources (drexel and external), be there for them for anything drexel-related, college-related, or anything in general. Give them co-op advice, career advice, class advice, etc. Point them towards opportunities, clubs, and programs that I did back in the day that really helped me, or that I missed out on and wished I‚Äôd done. Be there to answer any questions they may have! And hopefully help them to clarify their career/life goals.</p>

<h3 id="how-i-envision-my-relationship-with-my-mentees">How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s)</h3>

<p>One where I can give them helpful career-related advice to help their career, but also a close friendship that is about more than just careers.</p>
