  <h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>I usually don‚Äôt talk a lot, so when I do, you know it‚Äôs because I see you as a close friend and someone I can trust. I am a very picky and indecisive person to be around (if you ask for a place to eat, don‚Äôt ask me). I don‚Äôt have a lot of patience, but when I do, I wait forever. I love food. If you give me food, we can instantly be friends.</p>

<h3 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h3>

<p>I hope to pursue a career as a nurse anesthetist or nurse practitioner. Both very rewarding fields with amazing salaries. Although I am not interested in travel nursing, I do hope to one day travel all over the world for my own pleasure as well as experience what the healthcare system is like outside the U.S.</p>

<h3 id="interests">Interests</h3>

<p>I love to cook because it tastes better when you make it yourself. Tennis and Badminton are the only valid sports out there. If I had the money, I would travel and go on road trips with friends and family everyday. I also have an addition to Lego that people say I have a problem with.</p>

<h3 id="looking-for">Looking For</h3>

<p>I want a mentor that could share the same humor as me. I also want a mentor that helps promotes/encourages good things from me. I want to know what‚Äôs best for me, how to succeed, and the tips/hacks in life. Also, I want a mentor that has a never-ending list of where to eat food.</p>
