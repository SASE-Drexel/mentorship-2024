  <h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>I was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York City my entire life. Some of my hobbies include enjoy exploring the city and trying out new stuff. I‚Äôm a bit of an introvert so sometimes it‚Äôs hard for me to open up to people. But I like to give it my all in almost everything I do.</p>

<h3 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h3>

<p>I‚Äôm mainly interested in website design, but I‚Äôm also a bit interested in software development and want to try out that side. But outside of my major, I‚Äôm also interested in graphic design, social media/marketing, and the psychology of both and how it affects everyday life.</p>

<h3 id="interests">Interests</h3>

<p>As a small goal, I‚Äôd like to expand my skill set by getting comfortable with different types of design softwares and coding languages, such as Figma, Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop, and Javascript. I aim to get a good internship this year (and for my co-ops) and gain as much experience to build up my resume and portfolio before I graduate and hopefully become pretty knowledgeable on UX/UI design by then.</p>

<h3 id="looking-for">Looking For</h3>

<p>I‚Äôm looking for a mentor that‚Äôs preferably in the same major as me, and a third-year or higher as I‚Äôd like to get to know their experiences with co-op. I‚Äôd like someone that is easy to talk to, pretty responsive and both personable and professional when needed. I would like them to be open to giving feedback on projects or a portfolio and know how to give constructive criticism/advice.</p>
