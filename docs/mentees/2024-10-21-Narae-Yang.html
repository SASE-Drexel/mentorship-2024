  <h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>Hello! My name is Narae Yang. I go by She/Her pronouns. I was born in South Korea, and moved to the Unites States when I was around 6 years old. I‚Äôve been a Delawarian ever since. I would say I‚Äôm a hard worker (when it comes to my studies) but can get distracted very easily. My MBTI is INTJ, and my blood type is B. I‚Äôve almost drowned 4 separate times. I am allergic to cats and pollen. I‚Äôm 5 foot 2 and a half. I‚Äôve met John Fry once in my life, and one time my brother kicked my face and all three of my baby teeth fell out of my mouth.</p>

<h3 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h3>

<p>I have plans on graduating with my bachelor of science in EE. After that, I would like to get some real work experience before deciding on anything else. I do have a goal of eventually going to law school and becoming a patent attorney.</p>

<h3 id="interests">Interests</h3>

<p>I like cooking, baking, and eating food. In my spare time I like watching YouTube videos and playing video games. I also binge watch different shows, and I‚Äôm currently watching singles inferno. I play video games that aren‚Äôt too difficult in skill level but wastes lots of time, like Stardew valley.</p>

<h3 id="looking-for">Looking For</h3>

<p>I‚Äôm just looking for a mentor to maybe help guide me through maybe getting Co-ops/getting through classes. I‚Äôm also just looking for more connections and activities to do other that academics.</p>
