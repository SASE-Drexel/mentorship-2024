  <h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>Hi! I‚Äôm a freshman majoring in Computer Science. I am also an international student from Indonesia, so I am still adapting to my new environment.</p>

<h3 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h3>

<p>I would love to build my resume first because currently, I have no experience related to my field. I am looking for many club events and activities I could do to develop my experience and gain more exposure. I would also like to be involved in more projects that would fit my portfolio. I have been looking for internships catered to first-year and second-year students and I am hoping to have my resume ready before applications start rolling. I think having experience early on would ease my way into landing a preferred job later on after graduation.</p>

<h3 id="interests">Interests</h3>

<p>I haven‚Äôt had many opportunities to travel abroad, so I‚Äôm interested in taking a Study Abroad program to either Seoul, Taiwan or Singapore.</p>

<h3 id="looking-for">Looking For</h3>

<p>I am not too sure what concentration or minor to take I will be taking but I have been leaning towards Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence. I hope this mentorship program can help me find my interest and guide me academically, i.e., how to decide what classes to take for next term and how to choose a concentration and minor later. I am also hoping to hear more about my mentor‚Äôs professional experience and ask for advice on where to start. Coming from another country, I don‚Äôt know many people here, so hopefully I could make more connections and friends through this program.</p>
