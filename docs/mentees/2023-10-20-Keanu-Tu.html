  <h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>I am a pretty quiet person but I’ll talk when I feel comfortable. I’m pretty much down to do anything whether it be studying, playing games, watching shows, or just hanging out. I love cats, I have three of them. I push my homework and studying off a lot so I need to be constantly reminded to do things. I love all music besides country and will listen to anything you put on aux. I promise I respond fast and will almost always be down to do something unless I have homework that needs my urgent attention !!</p>

<h3 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h3>

<p>My career goal is to get a degree in computer science. My end goal is still a bit foggy but I’m interested in either software engineering or just programming with computer science in general.</p>

<h3 id="interests">Interests</h3>

<p>My main hobbies are either going to the gym or playing video games. The main games I play are Valorant, Minecraft, Stardew Valley, Roblox and Phasmophobia. I watch a decent amount of anime too (any genre).</p>

<h3 id="looking-for">Looking For</h3>

<p>I just want a mentor who I can feel comfortable with and come to with any questions or even problems. I would want someone who would be willing to be on a personal level with me. I want to feel like I can open up to them and I would also want to be a safe space for them. I would want to have somebody I could seek advice with and could help guide me on my academic journey in Drexel.</p>
