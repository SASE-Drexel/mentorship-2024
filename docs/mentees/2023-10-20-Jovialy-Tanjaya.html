  <h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>My name is Jovialy Tanjaya. I want to declare a Biology major with a minor in Bioinformatics or Data Science. I play competitive badminton, and I find it very enjoyable. It led me to many of my closest friends. I traveled to many places, especially nature parks since my family loves nature. I love going on walks and I’ll always choose the longer route if it is more scenic. I grew fond of it growing up. I studied abroad in Rome for Italian, and I hope I can continue to learn more languages.</p>

<h3 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h3>

<p>I enjoy biology as well as the environmental aspect of it. I love to travel and learn new languages. In my free time, I like to play the piano and guitar. I find baking very fun enjoy baking especially macarons even though it took me many times to perfect it.</p>

<h3 id="interests">Interests</h3>

<p>I want to graduate with a major in Biology and a minor in Bioinformatics or Data Science. I want to work with biotechnology. If that does not work out, I want to become a Physician Assistant who can work with kids.</p>

<h3 id="looking-for">Looking For</h3>

<p>In a mentor, I am looking for someone who can guide me through Drexel with the academics and social aspect. I hope my mentor can give me advice as I navigate Drexel as a first year. I want someone who can hold me accountable for my work and help me stay up to task. It is a two way street so I would do the same back. Lastly, I also want my mentor to be my friend who I can easily conversate with and go to cafes with.</p>
